The study is based on a reliable and representative publication set of 755 papers retrieved from the Web of Science database using keywords and citation links. In the course of the study we analyse several aspects of the emergence of this topic, the differentiation of methodological research, its application within and outside the field and the dissemination process of information among different disciplines in the sciences and social sciences. Finally, a cluster analysis of h-related literature is conducted. The hybrid clustering algorithm results in four clusters, which depict two different aspects each of basic and applied research related to the h-index and its derivatives.

There is growing evidence that this meso-level, between micro targets of typical IR and large disciplines handled by macro-level bibliometric studies, takes full advantage of hybrid approaches. Firstly, delineation tasks gain to combine the a priori thinking of traditional IR, which typically involves clearly targeted expectations, and the a posteriori thinking of bibliometric mapping, where the decisions are built on external structuring of the domain in a wider context. The combination of the two ways of thought is far from new, with IR increasingly building on bibliometric networks for query expansion, and bibliometrics building on IR for evaluating and refining its outcomes. Secondly, delineation benefits from the multi-network perspective, which gives different representations of the scientific topics, usually all the more converging than the objects are dense and well separated. Focusing on two basic networks-words and citations-various sequences or combinations of operations are discussed. Bibliometrics and IR, especially when properly combined in multi-network approaches, provide an efficient toolbox for studies of domains delimitation.

Other significant variables were those associated with highly productive co-authors. Contrary to our hypothesis, network structure as measured by components was not predictive.

To test whether the apparent advantage of internationally collaborative research may be due to additional interest in articles from the countries of the authors, this article assesses the extent to which the national affiliations of the authors of articles affect the national affiliations of their Mendeley readers. Based on English-language Web of Science articles in 10 fields from science, medicine, social science, and the humanities, the results of statistical models comparing author and reader affiliations suggest that, in most fields, Mendeley users are disproportionately readers of articles authored from within their own country. In addition, there are several cases in which Mendeley users from certain countries tend to ignore articles from specific other countries, although it is not clear whether this reflects national biases or different national specialisms within a field. In conclusion, research funders should not incentivize international collaboration on the basis that it is, in general, higher quality because its higher impact may be primarily due to its larger audience.

The main flavors of computer science research involve the theoretical development of conceptual models for the different aspects of computing and the more applicative building of software artifacts and assessment of their properties. In the computer science publication culture, conferences are an important vehicle to quickly move ideas, and journals often publish deeper versions of papers already presented at conferences. These peculiarities of the discipline make computer science an original research field within the sciences, and, therefore, the assessment of classical bibliometric laws is particularly important for this field. In this paper, we study the skewness of the distribution of citations to papers published in computer science publication venues (journals and conferences). We find that the skewness in the distribution of mean citedness of different venues combines with the asymmetry in citedness of articles in each venue, resulting in a highly asymmetric citation distribution with a power law tail. Furthermore, the skewness of conference publications is more pronounced than the asymmetry of journal papers.

Collaborations involve informal communication (i.e., conversational exchange) between researchers. Using self-reports from 100 tenured/tenure-track faculty in the College of Engineering at the University of South Florida, researchers' networks are constructed from their communication relationships and also from collaborations in three areas: joint publications, joint grant proposals, and joint patents. The data collection: (1) covers both researchers' in-progress and completed collaborative outputs, (2) yields a rating from the researchers on the importance of a relationship to them and (3) obtains multiple types of relationship ties between researchers allowing for the comparison of multiple networks. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) results show that the more communication researchers have the more likely they produce collaborative outputs.

Whence, on one hand, this paper very briefly examines bibliometric laws, like the h-index and subsequent debate about co-authorship effects, but on the other hand, proposes a measure of collaborative work through a new index. Based on data about the publication output of a specific research group, a new bibliometric law is found. Let a co-author C have written J (joint) publications with one or several colleagues. Rank all the co-authors of that individual according to their number of joint publications, giving a rank r to each co-author, starting with r = 1 for the most prolific. It is empirically found that a very simple relationship holds between the number of joint publications J by coauthors and their rank of importance, i.e., J ae 1/r. Thereafter, in the same spirit as for the Hirsch core, one can define a ""co-author core"", and introduce indices operating on an author.

We use measures from social network analysis (SNA) (i.e., normalized degree centrality, normalized closeness centrality, normalized betweenness centrality, normalized eigenvector centrality, average ties strength, and efficiency) for examining the effect of social networks on the (citation-based) performance of scholars in a given discipline (i.e., information systems). Results from our statistical analysis using a Poisson regression model suggest that research performance of scholars (g-index) is positively correlated with four SNA measures except for the normalized betweenness centrality and the normalized closeness centrality measures. Furthermore, it reveals that only normalized degree centrality, efficiency, and average ties strength have a positive significant influence on the g-index (as a performance measure). The normalized eigenvector centrality has a negative significant influence on the g-index. Based on these results, we can imply that scholars, who are connected to many distinct scholars, have a better citation-based performance (g-index) than scholars with fewer connections. Additionally, scholars with large average ties strengths (i.e., repeated co-authorships) show a better research performance than those with low tie strengths (e.g., single co-authorships with many different scholars). The results related to efficiency show that scholars, who maintain a strong co-authorship relationship to only one co-author of a group of linked co-authors, perform better than those researchers with many relationships to the same group of linked co-authors. The negative effect of the normalized eigenvector suggests that scholars should work with many students instead of other well-performing scholars.

The key to this methodology is the identification of a citation distribution with an income distribution. Once this step is taken, it is easy to realize that the measurement of low-impact coincides with the measurement of economic poverty. In turn, it is equally natural to identify the measurement of high-impact with the measurement of a certain notion of economic affluence. On the other hand, it is seen that the ranking of citation distributions according to a family of low-impact measures is essentially characterized by a number of desirable axioms. Appropriately redefined, these same axioms lead to the selection of an equally convenient class of decomposable high-impact measures. These two families are shown to satisfy other interesting properties that make them potentially useful in empirical applications, including the comparison of research units working in different fields.

This paves the way for several normalization procedures to perform reasonably well in reducing the effect on citation inequality of differences in citation practices. Secondly, independently of the year of publication and the length of the citation window, the effect of such differences represents about 13% of total citation inequality. Thirdly, a recently introduced two-parameter normalization scheme outperforms the other normalization procedures over the entire period, reducing citation disproportions to a level very close to the minimum achievable given the data and the classification system.

Fractional counting does provide results that are properly field normalized. We therefore recommend the use of fractional counting in bibliometric studies that require field normalization, especially in studies at the level of countries and research organizations.

Some of this lag can be avoided by using readership counts from the social reference sharing site Mendeley because these accumulate more quickly than citations. This article introduces a method to calculate national research impact indicators from Mendeley, using citation counts from older time periods to partially compensate for international biases in Mendeley readership. A refinement to accommodate recent national changes in Mendeley uptake makes little difference, despite being theoretically more accurate. The Mendeley patterns using the methods broadly reflect the results from similar calculations with citations and seem to reflect impact trends about a year earlier.

The 2-year journal impact factor (2-JIF) counts citations to one and two year old articles, while the 5-year journal impact factor (5-JIF) counts citations from one to five year old articles. Nevertheless, these indicators are not comparable among fields of science for two reasons: (i) each field has a different impact maturity time, and (ii) because of systematic differences in publication and citation behavior across disciplines. In fact, the 5-JIF firstly appeared in the journal Citation Reports OCR) in 2007 with the purpose of making more comparable impacts in fields in which impact matures slowly. However, there is not an optimal fixed impact maturity time valid for all the fields. In some of them two years provides a good performance whereas in others three or more years are necessary. Therefore, there is a problem when comparing a journal from a field in which impact matures slowly with a journal from a field in which impact matures rapidly. In this work, we propose the 2-year maximum journal impact factor (2M-JIF), a new impact indicator that considers the 2-year rolling citation time window of maximum impact instead of the previous 2-year time window. Finally, an empirical application comparing 2-JIF, 5-JIF, and 2M-JIF shows that the maximum rolling target window reduces the between-group variance with respect to the within-group variance in a random sample of about six hundred journals from eight different fields.

As the results show, besides being associated with quality, citation counts are correlated with the citation performance of the cited references, the language of the publishing journal, the chemical subfield, and the reputation of the authors. In this study no statistically significant correlation was found between citation counts and number of authors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a support-vector model of machine learning to classify disciplines based on relative frequencies of social and epistemic terms, we were able to markedly improve accuracy over a random selection baseline (distinguishing between disciplines with as high as 90% accuracy) as well as acquire sets of most indicative terms for each discipline by their relative presence or absence. These lists were then considered in light of findings of sociological and epistemological studies of disciplines and found to validate the approach's measure of social and epistemic disciplinary identities and contrasts.

First, homophily structures collaboration when scientists adhere to a norm of exclusivity in selecting similar partners at a higher rate than dissimilar ones. Two dimensions on which similarity between scientists can be assessed are their research specialties and status positions. Second, focus constraint shapes collaboration when connections among scientists depend on opportunities for social contact. Constraint comes in two forms, depending on whether it originates in institutional or geographic space. Institutional constraint refers to the tendency of scientists to select collaborators within rather than across institutional boundaries. Geographic constraint is the principle that, when collaborations span different institutions, they are more likely to involve scientists that are geographically co-located than dispersed. To study homophily and focus constraint, the paper will argue in favour of an idea of collaboration that moves beyond formal co-authorship to include also other forms of informal intellectual exchange that do not translate into the publication of joint work. A community-detection algorithm for formalising this perspective will be proposed and applied to the co-authorship network of the scientists that submitted to the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise in Business and Management in the UK. While results only partially support research-based homophily, they indicate that scientists use status positions for discriminating between potential partners by selecting collaborators from institutions with a rating similar to their own. Strong support is provided in favour of institutional and geographic constraints. Scientists tend to forge intra-institutional collaborations; yet, when they seek collaborators outside their own institutions, they tend to select those who are in geographic proximity.

This necessity for sharper accuracy challenges standard methodology based on pre-defined subject categories. This paper proposes a way to define a reference domain that is more strongly delimited than in standard methodology, by building it up out of cells of the partition created by the pre-defined subject categories and their intersections. This partition approach can be applied to different existing field normalization variants. The resulting reference domain lies between those generated by standard field normalization and journal normalization. Examples based on fictive and real publication records illustrate how the potential impact on results can exceed or be smaller than the effect of other currently debated normalization variants, depending on the case studied.

It describes a computer simulation in which academic papers are generated with authors, references, contents, and an extrinsic value, and must pass through peer review to become published. We demonstrate that the model can fit bibliometric data for a token journal, Research Policy. Different practices for generating authors and references produce different distributions of papers per author and citations per paper, including the scale-free distributions typical of cumulative advantage processes. We also demonstrate the model's ability to simulate collective learning or problem solving, for which we use Kauffman's NK fitness landscape. The model provides evidence that those practices leading to cumulative advantage in citations, that is, papers with many citations becoming even more cited, do not improve scientists' ability to find good solutions to scientific problems, compared to those practices that ignore past citations.

Existing output measures alone cannot adequately capture this process.

Emerging measures in network dynamics (particularly betweenness centrality and diversity), and entropy are promising as indicators, but their use requires sophisticated interpretations.

Also, promotion to the next higher h depends only on citations received by a small subset of papers, so that researchers with a given h may have citation curves whose top and tail reveal a weaker impact than that of researchers with a lower h. To overcome these problems, we propose a two-sided h index, an extension that computes additional h indices progressively up the top and out the tail of the citation curve. This extension represents a citation curve descriptor one of whose elements is the scalar h. The advantages of the two-sided h index are illustrated through analysis of citation curves for 88 researchers with h indices ranging from 8 to 20. Several schemes are also discussed that use the two-sided h index to define criteria for ranking researchers within and across scalar h indices, according to whether the top of the citation curve, its tail, or both are deemed relevant under the circumstances in which research accomplishments are assessed.

Indicator scores and scholar rankings calculated in Web of Science (WoS) and Google Scholar (GS) were analyzed. The indexing policies of WoS and GS were found to have a direct effect on the amount of available bibliometric data, thus indicator scores and rankings in WoS and GS were different, correlations between 0.24 and 0.99.

Normalization of citation impact indicators is usually done based on a field classification system. In practice, the Web of Science journal subject categories are often used for this purpose. However, many of these subject categories have a quite broad scope and are not sufficiently homogeneous in terms of citation practices. As an alternative, we propose to work with algorithmically constructed classification systems. We construct these classification systems by performing a large-scale clustering of publications based on their citation relations. In our analysis, 12 classification systems are constructed, each at a different granularity level. The number of fields in these systems ranges from 390 to 73,205 in granularity levels 1-12. This contrasts with the 236 subject categories in the WoS classification system. Based on an investigation of some key characteristics of the 12 classification systems, we argue that working with a few thousand fields may be an optimal choice. We then study the effect of the choice of a classification system on the citation impact of the 500 universities included in the 2013 edition of the CWTS Leiden Ranking. We consider both the MNCS and the PPtop 10% indicator. Globally, for all the universities taken together citation impact indicators generally turn out to be relatively insensitive to the choice of a classification system.

(2) What information does a specific closeness distribution of collaborating researchers convey with regard to the flow of knowledge through collaborative activities? (3) What is the temporal dynamics of large-scale structure formation in these networks? The work involves a comparative study of these characteristics using the networks of two countries: India and the US.

In this paper, we show that three factors can account for the referencing pattern of citation networks for two topics, namely ""graphenes"" and ""complex networks"", thus allowing one to reproduce the topological features of the networks built with papers being the nodes and the edges established by citations. The most relevant factor was content similarity, while the other two - in-degree (i.e. citation counts) and age of publication - had varying importance depending on the topic studied. This dependence indicates that additional factors could play a role. Indeed, by intuition one should expect the reputation (or visibility) of authors and/or institutions to affect the referencing pattern, and this is only indirectly considered via the in-degree that should correlate with such reputation. Because information on reputation is not readily available, we simulated its effect on artificial citation networks considering two communities with distinct fitness (visibility) parameters. One community was assumed to have twice the fitness value of the other, which amounts to a double probability for a paper being cited. While the h-index for authors in the community with larger fitness evolved with time with slightly higher values than for the control network (no fitness considered), a drastic effect was noted for the community with smaller fitness.

When a ranking of scholars is needed, for instance in grant, award, or promotion procedures, their use is the fastest and cheapest way of prioritizing some scientists over others. However, due to their nature, there is a danger of oversimplifying scientific achievements. Therefore, many other indicators have been proposed including the usage of the PageRank algorithm known for the ranking of webpages and its modifications suited to citation networks. Nevertheless, this recursive method is computationally expensive and even if it has the advantage of favouring prestige over popularity, its application should be well justified, particularly when compared to the standard citation counts. In this study, we analyze three large datasets of computer science papers in the categories of artificial intelligence, software engineering, and theory and methods and apply 12 different ranking methods to the citation networks of authors.

Among various indicators for evaluating the quality of research with multiple authors, harmonic counting is relatively superior in terms of calculation, scientific ethics, and application. However, two important factors in harmonic counting are not yet clearly understood. These factors are the perceptions of scientists regarding the (1) corresponding author and (2) equally credited authors (ECAs). We carry out a survey investigation on different perceptions of author position versus contribution among medical researchers with different subfields and professional ranks in China, in order to provide several pieces of evidence on the aforementioned factors. We are surprised to find that researchers with different professional ranks tend to largely acknowledge their own contribution in collaborative research. Next, we conduct an empirical study to measure individual's citation impact using inflated counts versus harmonic counts. The results indicate that harmonic h-index cannot reflect the high peak of harmonic citations. Therefore, we use (1) harmonic R-index to differentiate authors based on the harmonic citations of each paper belonging to their respective h-cores; and (2) Normalization harmonic (h, R) index as a meaningful indicator in ranking scientists.

Denmark still leads but the gap narrowed in 2013 as Norway's credit increased 58%, while Denmark's credit increased only 5.4%, even though Norway had 36% fewer, and Denmark 40% more, coauthor contributions than in 2012. Concurrently, the credit produced by the least productive half of the contributions rose tenfold from 0.9% to 10.1% for Norway, but dropped from 7.2% to 5.7% for Denmark. Overall, contributory inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient, fell from 0.78 to 0.51 for Norway, but rose from 0.63 to 0.68 for Denmark. Neither gap narrowing nor the positive association between reduced contributory inequality and increased credit were detected by conventional metrics. Conventional metrics are confounded by equalizing bias (EqB) which favours small contributors at the expense of large contributors, and which carries an element of reverse meritocracy and systemic injustice into bibliometric performance assessment. EqB was corrected by using all relevant byline information from every coauthored publication in the source data. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of using EqB-corrected publication credit in gap assessment at the national level. (C) 2015 The Author.

The main problem with the h index of different authors calculated by using the above relation is that it underestimates the ranking of scientists publishing papers receiving very high citations and results in high values of A.

To overcome the drawback of a wide range of A associated with the discreteness of h for different authors, a simple index, the radius R of circular citation area, defined as R = (L/pi)(1/2) approximate to h, is suggested. This circular citation area radius R is easy to calculate and improves the ranking of scientists publishing high-impact papers.

Hiring, promotion, and funding decisions increasingly rely on a variety of impact metrics that cannot disentangle quality from quantity of scientific output, and are biased by factors such as discipline and academic age. Biases affecting the evaluation of single papers are compounded when one aggregates citation-based metrics across an entire publication record. It is not trivial to compare the quality of two scholars that during their careers have published at different rates, in different disciplines, and in different periods of time. Here we evaluate a method based on the generation of a statistical baseline specifically tailored on the academic profile of each researcher. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in decoupling the roles of quantity and quality of publications to explain how a certain level of impact is achieved. The method can be extended to simultaneously suppress any source of bias. As an illustration, we use it to capture the quality of the work of Nobel laureates irrespective of number of publications, academic age, and discipline, even when traditional metrics indicate low impact in absolute terms. The procedure is flexible enough to allow for the evaluation of, and fair comparison among, arbitrary collections of papers - scholar publication records, journals, and institutions; in fact, it extends a similar technique that was previously applied to the ranking of research units and countries in specific disciplines (Crespo), Ortuno-Orti, & Ruiz-Castillo, 2012). We further apply the methodology to almost a million scholars and over six thousand journals to measure the impact that cannot be explained by the volume of publications alone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Bibliometric data extracted from 74,021 Scopus research records published from 1965 to 2015 were examined using impact and productivity measures as well as co-word and domain visualization techniques. This scientometric study presents a comprehensive view of the information security specialty from several perspectives (e.g., temporal, seminal papers, institutions, sources, authors). After a long and steady period of growth (1965-2004), an exponential publication output occurred between 2005 and 2010. Among all the countries involved in information security research, the United States and China had the greatest impact, and China has surpassed the United States in terms of productivity. Information security as a specialty is largely populated by publications from the technical fields of computer science and engineering. Several research themes were found throughout the decades (e.g., cryptography and information security management and administration), and emergent research subspecialties appeared in later decades (e.g., intrusion detection, medical data security, steganography, wireless security).

It is therefore important to view bibliometric techniques as a family of approaches to KO in order to illustrate their relative strengths and weaknesses. The subfield of bibliometrics concerned with citation analysis forms a distinct approach to KO which is characterized by its social, historical and dynamic nature, its close dependence on scholarly literature and its explicit kind of literary warrant. The two main methods, co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling represent different things and thus neither can be considered superior for all purposes. The main difference between traditional knowledge organization systems (KOSs) and maps based on citation analysis is that the first group represents intellectual KOSs, whereas the second represents social KOSs. For this reason bibliometric maps cannot be expected ever to be fully equivalent to scholarly taxonomies, but they are - along with other forms of KOSs - valuable tools for assisting users' to orient themselves to the information ecology.

Additionally, Z is less sensitive to local changes in a scientist's citation profile, namely perturbations which increase h while only marginally affecting C. Using real career data for 476 physicists careers and 488 biologist careers, we analyze both the distribution of Z and the rank stability of Z with respect to the Hirsch index h and the Egghe index g. We analyze careers distributed across a wide range of total impact, including top-cited physicists and biologists for benchmark comparison. In practice, the Z-index requires the same information needed to calculate h and could be effortlessly incorporated within career profile databases, such as Google Scholar and ResearcherID. Because Z incorporates information from the entire publication profile while being more robust than h and g to local perturbations, we argue that Z is better suited for ranking comparisons in academic decision-making scenarios comprising a large number of scientists.

This paper is concerned with rigorous empirical detection of power-law behaviour in the distribution of citations received by the most highly cited scientific papers. We have used a large, novel data set on citations to scientific papers published between 1998 and 2002 drawn from Scopus. The power-law model is compared with a number of alternative models using a likelihood ratio test. We have found that the power-law hypothesis is rejected for around half of the Scopus fields of science. For these fields of science, the Yule, power-law with exponential cut-off and log-normal distributions seem to fit the data better than the pure power-law model. On the other hand, when the power-law hypothesis is not rejected, it is usually empirically indistinguishable from most of the alternative models. The pure power-law model seems to be the best model only for the most highly cited papers in ""Physics and Astronomy"". Overall, our results seem to support theories implying that the most highly cited scientific papers follow the Yule, power-law with exponential cut-off or log-normal distribution. Our findings suggest also that power laws in citation distributions, when present, account only for a very small fraction of the published papers (less than 1 % for most of science fields) and that the power-law scaling parameter (exponent) is substantially higher (from around 3.2 to around 4.7) than found in the older literature.",1.57,65,2015,4,278,2.084,8,16,1,23,154,6

The paper discusses two core problems with the JIF: first, citations of documents are generally not normally distributed, and, furthermore, the distribution is affected by outliers, which has serious consequences for the use of the mean value in the JIF calculation. Second, the JIF is affected by bias factors that have nothing to do with the prestige or quality of a journal (e.g., document type).

We introduce a new citation-rank approach having these properties, namely P100; (2) we compare the reliability of P100 empirically with other percentile-based approaches, such as the approaches developed by the SCImago group, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), and Thomson Reuters (InCites), using all papers published in 1980 in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS). How accurately can the different approaches predict the long-term citation impact in 2010 (in year 31) using citation impact measured in previous time windows (years 1-30)?

Researchers create and sustain academic societies as a result of social interactions. This study takes a social network perspective to understand researchers' associations using two Organisation of Islamic Co-operation nations, Turkey and Malaysia, in the fast-developing field of 'Energy Fuels'. The study found both similarities and differences in the scholarly networks of these two countries. The mean distance between the authors in the Turkey and Malaysia networks was 8.4 and 6.5, respectively, confirming the small world nature of these networks. The popularity, position, and prestige of the authors in the network, as determined through centrality measures, had a statistically significant effect on research performance. These measures, however, were far more correlated with the research performance of the authors in the Malaysia network than in the Turkey network. PageRank centrality was found to be the most efficient topological measure when it came to correlation with research performance. We used authors' 'degree' to reach to the 'core' ('Deg-Core') of the network (in contrast to the K-Core method), which was found to capture more productive authors. A method to detect academic communities of productive authors by extracting motifs (large cliques) from the network is suggested. Finally, we visualize the cognitive structure of both countries using a 2-mode network representing research focus areas (RFAs) and prominent authors working in these RFAs.",1.38,25,2014,9,269,2.183,20,28,2,28,251,8

We claim that the use of such tests do not provide any advantages in relation to deciding whether differences between citation indicators are important or not.

2317,292,1,10.1002/asi.23248,3,broker,"In scientometrics, citer behavior is traditionally investigated using one of two main approaches. According to the normative point of view, the behavior of scientists is regulated by norms that make the detection of citation patterns useful for the interpretation of bibliometric measures. According to the constructivist perspective, citer behavior is influenced by other factors linked to the social and/or psychological sphere that do not allow any statistical inferences that are useful for the purposes of interpretation. An intermediate position supports normative theories in describing citer behavior with respect to high citation frequencies and constructivist theories with respect to low citation counts. In this paper, this idea was tested in a case study of the Italian sociology community. Italian sociology is characterized by an unusual organization into three political or ideological camps, and belonging to one camp can be considered a potentially strong constructivist reason to cite. An all-author co-citation analysis was performed to map the structure of the Italian sociology community and look for evidence of three camps. We did not expect to find evidence of this configuration in the co-citation map. The map, in fact, included authors who obtained high citation counts that are supposedly produced by a normative-oriented behavior. The results confirmed this hypothesis and showed that the clusters seemed to be divided according to topic and not by camp. Relevant scientific works were cited by the members of the entire community regardless of their membership in any particular camp.",1.28,4,2015,1,259,1.864,18,11,1,2,18,2

The academic age of individuals, measured as the number of years since obtaining a Ph.D. up to 2007, is used to measure productivity per year. Independently of the two productivity measures, and both before and after age normalization, the five main findings of the paper are the following. Firstly, individuals within each department have very different productivities. Secondly, there is not a single pattern of productivity inequality and skewness at the department level. On the contrary, productivity distributions are very different across departments. Thirdly, the effect on overall productivity inequality of differences in productivity distributions between departments is greater than the analogous effect in other contexts. Fourth, to a large extent, this effect on overall productivity inequality is accounted for by scale factors well captured by departments' mean productivities.

Since the research was particularly interested in the correlation between altmetrics counts and citation counts, this overview focuses particularly on this correlation. For each altmetric, a meta-analysis is calculated for its correlation with traditional citation counts. As the results of the meta-analyses show, the correlation with traditional citations for micro-blogging counts is negligible (pooled r = 0.003), for blog counts it is small (pooled r = 0.12) and for bookmark counts from online reference managers, medium to large (CiteULike pooled r = 0.23; Mendeley pooled r = 0.51).",1.14,90,2015,7,157,2.084,11,22,1,353,10484,51

Based upon journal rankings 2004-2014 in 50 sub-categories within 5 broad categories, this study shows that journal rankings based on JIF variants tend to be more stable over time if the geometric mean is used rather than the standard mean. The same is true for JIF variants using Mendeley reader counts instead of citation counts. Thus, although the difference is not large, the geometric mean is recommended instead of the arithmetic mean for future JIF calculations.

Using a bipartite network analysis of journals and subject categories, a core-intermediary-periphery diffusion structure is detected through comparative analysis of betweenness centrality over time. Systems biology diffuses from a core of foundational, theoretical areas to more specific, applied, practical fields, most of which relate to human health. Next, cluster analysis is applied to subject category co-occurrence networks to longitudinally trace the movement of fields within the core-intermediary-periphery structure. The results of these analyses reveal patterns of systems biology's diffusion across both theoretical and applied fields, and are also used to suggest how the dynamics of a field's interdisciplinary evolution can be realized.

We applied the commonly used all-initials and first-initial based disambiguation methods to the data, generated over-time networks with a yearly resolution, and calculated standard network metrics on these graphs. Our results show that initial-based methods underestimate the number of unique authors, average distance, and clustering coefficient, while overestimating the number of edges, average degree, and ratios of the largest components.

In particular, the future UK Research Excellence Framework (REF), proposes using citation data in the research evaluation of articles published as recently as the year prior to the evaluation. In response to this move, this research develops an indicator at the level of individual articles that, when normalized, can supplement peer review. The new hybrid indicator is the weighted sum of two indicators in common usage: the article's total number of citations in a citation window, and the Impact Factor of the journal in which the article was published. This research compares this new indicator with the article's total number of citations in a longer citation window (the standard indicator of article impact). For citation windows of 0 or 1 years, the correlation of the simplified weighted sum with long-term citation is substantially higher than the correlation of the standard indicator of article citation with long-term citation. Moreover, for citation windows of as long as 3 years the standard indicator of citation correlates significantly with the month of publication, in that articles published earlier in the year are on average more highly cited than those published later in the year. By contrast, the skewing of the simplified weighted sum towards articles published early in the year is considerably less than that of the standard indicator. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis was performed based upon articles obtained from the ISI Web of Knowledge online database. The results revealed that although all 27 sturgeon species have been objects of the research, species that are endangered or facing a high probability of extinction have received disproportionately less attention. White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) was the most frequently studied species, but it was recently surpassed by Persian sturgeon (A. persicus). Early life phases have been among the central objects of the research, and genetics, especially the use of microsatellite DNA, is becoming increasingly popular and had the highest impact. Research related to aquaculture was prominent, while the research related to hybrids (as a commodity of aquaculture production) was decreasing in popularity. Papers dealing with conservation issues were most frequently focused on European sturgeon (A. sturio). A steady increase in the number of published articles over time was observed. However, the overall citation rate declined significantly over time. During the period reviewed, the sturgeon research published in peer reviewed journals dominantly originated from the USA and EU.

Meanwhile, the share of nanotechnology papers involving at least one Chinese author increased substantially over the last two decades. Papers involving Chinese authors are far less likely to be internationally co-authored than papers involving authors from other countries. Nonetheless, this appears to be changing as Chinese nanotechnology research becomes more advanced. An arithmetic decomposition confirms that China's growing share of such research accounts, in large part, for the observed stagnation of international collaboration. Thus two aspects of the globalization of science can work in opposing directions: diffusion to initially less scientifically advanced countries can depress international collaboration rates, while at the same time scientific advances in such countries can reverse this trend. We find that the growth of China's scientific community explains some, but not all of the dynamics of China's international collaboration rate. We therefore provide an institutional account of these dynamics, drawing on Stichweh's [Social Science information 35(2):327-340, 1996] original paper on international scientific collaboration, which, in examining the interrelated development of national and international scientific networks, predicts a transitional phase during which science becomes a more national enterprise, followed by a phase marked by accelerating international collaboration. Validating the application of this approach, we show that Stichweh's predictions, based on European scientific communities in the 18th and 19th centuries, seem to apply to the Chinese scientific community in the 21st century.",0.94,7,2012,5,283,2.133,10,20,5,25,260,9

We surveyed a random sample of 1,065 authors who contributed a peer-reviewed journal article indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) in 2005 and at least one other article during the period of 2001-2004 in four academic disciplines representing natural sciences (biochemistry and water resources) and social sciences (anthropology and economics). We then report on the relationships between demographic variables (gender and race/ethnicity) and career-related variables (academic rank, discipline, and h-index) of these authors. Our findings show that at every career level and within each discipline, women were under-represented in academic positions compared to men and an even lower percentage of women published at each academic level than were employed at that level. Further, we found that women had lower h-indices than men in all four disciplines surveyed. Societal and biological constraints may reduce women's ability to obtain research intensive positions and contribute to these gender disparities. Hispanics and blacks were underrepresented among individuals awarded with doctoral degrees, doctorate recipients employed in academia, and academics publishing in WoS as compared to their representation in the population.

The main result is that, in spite of wide differences in production and citation practices across fields, the shape of field productivity distributions is very similar across fields. The parallelism of the results for the population as a whole and for the subset of successful authors, when productivity is measured as mean citation per article per person, reveals the fractal nature of the skewness of scientific productivity in this case.

Here we present a novel, big-data method to quantify the extents of cognitive domains of different bodies of scientific literature independently from publication volume, and apply it to 20 million articles published over 60-130 years in physics, astronomy, and biomedicine. The method is based on the lexical diversity of titles of fixed quotas of research articles. Owing to large size of quotas, the method overcomes the inherent stochasticity of article titles to achieve <1% precision. We show that the periods of cognitive growth do not necessarily coincide with the trends in publication volume. Furthermore, we show that the articles produced by larger teams cover significantly smaller cognitive territory than (the same quota of) articles from smaller teams. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role of small teams and individual researchers in expanding the cognitive boundaries of science.

In early time periods, articles with higher orthodoxy rates were cited more, but this effect dissipated over time. In contrast, citations associated with closeness centrality increased over time. Early SSS citation networks were smaller, less structurally cohesive and less modular than later networks. In contrast, later networks were larger, more structurally cohesive, more modular and less dense.

Authors in biochemistry had on average twice the h-index of those in economics, anthropology and water resources. Biochemists had higher expectations about the number of articles published for hire and promotion, more strongly valued interdisciplinary publishing, felt the cutting edge of their science was clearer, and had more defined patterns of author credit assignment than the other disciplines. Anthropologists exhibited a lower relationship between h-index and the number of years since their first publication.

China saw a strong growth in scientific publications in the last decade, to some extent due to increasing research and development expenditure. China has been more active in ESI fields of chemistry and physics, but more excellent in materials science, engineering and mathematics. Most publications were concerned with the common Science Citation Index subject categories of multidisciplinary chemistry, multidisciplinary materials and science, and physical chemistry. About one half China's ESC papers were internationally collaborative and the eight major industrialized countries (the USA, Germany, the UK, Japan, France, Canada, Russia, and Italy) played a prominent role in scientific collaboration with China, especially the USA. The Chinese Academy of Sciences took the leading position of institutions with many branches.

The new, substantially enhanced version of the web application and the generalized linear mixed model for binomial data on which it is based are described in this paper. Scopus data are used which have been collected for the SCImago Institutions Ranking. Only those universities and research-focused institutions are considered that have published at least 500 articles, reviews and conference papers in the period 2006-2010 in a certain Scopus subject area. In the enhanced version, the effect of single covariates (such as the per capita GDP of a country in which an institution is located) on two performance metrics (best paper rate and best journal rate) is examined and visualized. A covariate-adjusted ranking and mapping of the institutions is produced in which the single covariates are held constant. The results on the performance of institutions can then be interpreted as if the institutions all had the same value (reference point) for the covariate in question. For example, those institutions can be identified worldwide showing a very good performance despite a bad financial situation in the corresponding country. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The data involve citation exchanges in Internet research among 680 journals in 12 subject areas from 2000 to 2013. Assortative mixing by discipline and publication foci is a significant tie-generative mechanism in journal citation networks. The magnitude of as sortative mixing by discipline remains stable over time, whereas that by publication foci declines over time. Journals in Internet research demonstrate an increasing preference for influential journals to form citation links over time. The indegree of journals does not exert a significant impact on citation link formation among journals, whereas the outdegree of journals imposes a significantly negative impact on citation link formation among journals. Triadic closure is an important force that facilitates the formation of citation links among journals.

A fair assessment therefore requires that the criteria for selecting references in a given manuscript should be unbiased with regard to the authors or journals cited. In this paper, we assess approaches for citations considering two recommendations for authors to follow while preparing a manuscript: (i) consider similarity of contents with the topics investigated, lest related work should be reproduced or ignored; (ii) perform a systematic search over the network of citations including seminal or very related papers. We use formalisms of complex networks for two datasets of papers from the arXiv and the Web of Science repositories to show that neither of these two criteria is fulfilled in practice. By representing the texts as complex networks we estimated a similarity index between pieces of texts and found that the list of references did not contain the most similar papers in the dataset. This was quantified by calculating a consistency index, whose maximum value is one if the references in a given paper are the most similar in the dataset. For the areas of ""complex networks"" and ""graphenes"", the consistency index was only 0.11-0.23 and 0.10-0.25, respectively. To simulate a systematic search in the citation network, we employed a traditional random walk search (i.e. diffusion) and a random walk whose probabilities of transition are proportional to the number of the ingoing edges of the neighbours. The frequency of visits to the nodes (papers) in the network had a very small correlation with either the actual list of references in the papers or with the number of downloads from the arXiv repository. Therefore, apparently the authors and users of the repository did not follow the criterion related to a systematic search over the network of citations. Based on these results, we propose an approach that we believe is fairer for evaluating and complementing citations of a given author, effectively leading to a virtual scientometry.",0.73,29,2012,3,366,2.133,12,16,4,64,1270,27

Recently, a significant research effort has been invested into transferring the probabilistic topic modeling concept from monolingual to multilingual settings. Novel topic models have been designed to work with parallel and comparable texts. We define multilingual probabilistic topic modeling (MuPTM) and present the first full overview of the current research, methodology, advantages and limitations in MuPTM. As a representative example, we choose a natural extension of the omnipresent LDA model to multilingual settings called bilingual LDA (BiLDA). We provide a thorough overview of this representative multilingual model from its high-level modeling assumptions down to its mathematical foundations. We demonstrate how to use the data representation by means of output sets of (i) per-topic word distributions and (ii) per-document topic distributions coming from a multilingual probabilistic topic model in various real-life cross-lingual tasks involving different languages, without any external language pair dependent translation resource: (1) cross-lingual event-centered news clustering, (2) cross-lingual document classification, (3) cross-lingual semantic similarity, and (4) cross-lingual information retrieval.

An evaluation of the retrieval quality when science model driven services are used turned out that the models proposed actually provide beneficial effects to retrieval quality.

We formulate six propositions that summarise our theoretical expectations and are empirically testable: (1) a scientist's work consists of multiple finite research trails; (2) a scientist will work in several parallel research trails; (3) a scientist's role in research trail selection changes along the lifecycle; (4) a scientist's portfolio will converge before it diverges; (5) the rise and fall of research trails is associated with career changes; and (6) the rise and fall of research trails is associated with the potential for reputational gain. Four propositions are confirmed, the fifth is rejected, and the sixth could not be confirmed or rejected. In combination, the results of the four confirmed propositions reveal specific search strategies along the academic lifecycle.

The aim of this study was to appraise the differences among major research fields in scopus and wos based on a standardized classification of fields and assessed for the case of an entire country (Slovenia). We analyzed all documents and citations received by authors who were actively engaged in research in Slovenia between 1996 and 2011 (50,000 unique documents by 10,000 researchers). Documents were tracked and linked to scopus and wos using complex algorithms in the Slovenian cobiss bibliographic system and sicris research system where the subject areas or research fields of all documents are harmonized by the Frascati/oecd classification, thus offsetting some major differences between wos and scopus in database-specific subject schemes as well as limitations of deriving data directly from databases. scopus leads over wos in indexed documents as well as citations in all research fields. This is especially evident in social sciences, humanities, and engineering & technology. The least citations per document were received in humanities and most citations in medical and natural sciences, which exhibit similar counts. Engineering & technology reveals only half the citations per document compared to the previous two fields. Agriculture is found in the middle.

In this paper, we investigate the structure and the success of interdisciplinary scientific research teams. We examine the assembly factors using a sample of 1103 grant proposals submitted to two National Science Foundation interdisciplinary initiatives during a 3-year period, including both awarded and non-awarded proposals. The results indicate that individuals' likelihood of collaboration on a proposal is higher among those with longer tenure, lower institutional tier, lower H-index, and with higher levels of prior co-authorship and citation relationships. However, successful proposals have a little bit different relational patterns: individuals' likelihood of collaboration is higher among those with lower institutional tier, lower H-index, (female) gender, higher levels of prior co-authorship, but with lower levels of prior citation relationships.

The paper considers a situation in which the world citation distribution in 22 scientific fields is partitioned into three geographical areas: the U. S., the European Union (EU), and the rest of the world (RW). Given a critical citation level (CCL), we suggest using two real valued indicators to describe the shape of each area's distribution: a high-and a low-impact measure defined over the set of articles with citations below or above the CCL. It is found that, when the CCL is fixed at the 80th percentile of the world citation distribution, the U. S. performs dramatically better than the EU and the RW according to both indicators in all scientific fields. This superiority generally increases as we move from the incidence to the intensity and the citation inequality aspects of the phenomena in question. Surprisingly, changes observed when the CCL is increased from the 80th to the 95th percentile are of a relatively small order of magnitude. Finally, it is found that international co-authorship increases the high-impact and reduces the low-impact level in the three geographical areas.

It is therefore important to identify factors affecting citation scores that are unrelated to scholarly quality or usefulness so that these can be taken into account.

Citation counts tend to follow a discrete lognormal distribution and, in the absence of alternatives, have been investigated with negative binomial regression. Using simulated discrete lognormal data (continuous lognormal data rounded to the nearest integer) this article shows that a better strategy is to add one to the citations, take their log and then use the general linear (ordinary least squares) model for regression (e. g., multiple linear regression, ANOVA), or to use the generalised linear model without the log. Reasonable results can also be obtained if all the zero citations are discarded, the log is taken of the remaining citation counts and then the general linear model is used, or if the generalised linear model is used with the continuous lognormal distribution.

By introducing semantic patent analysis with advantages in representing technological objectives and structures, this paper constructs dynamic patent maps to show technological competition trends and describes the strategic functions of the dynamic maps. The proposed maps are based on subject-action-object (SAO) structures that are syntactically ordered sentences extracted using the natural language processing of the patent text; the structures of a patent encode the key findings of the invention and expertise of its inventors. Therefore, this paper introduces a method of constructing dynamic patent maps using SAO-based content analysis of patents and presents several types of dynamic patent maps by combining patent bibliographic information and patent mapping and clustering techniques. Building on the maps, this paper provides further analyses to identify technological areas in which patents have not been granted (""patent vacuums""), areas in which many patents have actively appeared (""technological hot spots""), R&D overlap of technological competitors, and characteristics of patent clusters. The proposed analyses of dynamic patent maps are illustrated using patents related to the synthesis of carbon nanotubes.

We demonstrate how the new design facilitates a portfolio analysis in terms of patterns emerging from the distributions of citation threads and the dynamics of trajectories as a function of space and time.

Firstly, research questions are approached using inputs from a variety of disciplinary fields. Secondly, the results of this multidisciplinary research feed back into the various research fields. This may either contribute to the further development of these fields, or may lead to disciplinary reconfiguration. If the latter is the case, a new interdisciplinary field may emerge. Following this perspective, the scientific landscape of river research and river science is mapped to assess to which current river research is a multi-disciplinary endeavor, and to which extent it results in a new emerging (inter) disciplinary field of river science. The paper suggests that this two level approach is a useful method to study interdisciplinary research and, more generally, disciplinary dynamics. With respect to river research, we show that it is mainly performed in several fields (limnology, fisheries & fish research, hydrology & water resources, and geomorphology) that hardly exchange knowledge.

However, river science does not emerge as an interdisciplinary field, and often-mentioned new interdisciplinary fields such as hydroecology or hydromorphology are not (yet) visible.

The effects of ""delayed recognition"" on impact indicators have importance and are of interest not only to bibliometricians but also among research managers and scientists themselves. It has been suggested that the ""Mendel syndrome"" is a potential drawback when assessing individual researchers through impact measures. If publications from particular researchers need more time than ""normal"" to be properly acknowledged by their colleagues, the impact of these researchers may be underestimated with common citation windows. In this paper, we answer the question whether the bibliometric indicators for scientists can be significantly affected by the Mendel syndrome. Applying a methodology developed previously for the classification of papers according to their durability (Costas et al., J Am Soc Inf Sci Technol 61(8):1564-1581, 2010a; J Am Soc Inf Sci Technol 61(2):329-339, 2010b), the scientific production of 1,064 researchers working at the Spanish Council for Scientific Research (CSIC) in three different research areas has been analyzed.

In response, they are often correlated with quality ratings or with other quantitative indicators in order to partly assess their validity. When correlations are calculated for sets of publications from multiple disciplines or years, however, the magnitude of the correlation coefficient may be reduced, masking the strength of the underlying correlation. This article uses simulations to systematically investigate the extent to which mixing years or disciplines reduces correlations. The results show that mixing two sets of articles with different correlation strengths can reduce the correlation for the combined set to substantially below the average of the two. Moreover, even mixing two sets of articles with the same correlation strength but different mean citation counts can substantially reduce the correlation for the combined set. The extent of the reduction in correlation also depends upon whether the articles assessed have been pre-selected for being high quality and whether the relationship between the quality ratings and citation counts is linear or exponential. The results underline the importance of using homogeneous data sets but also help to interpret correlation coefficients when this is impossible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, changes in academic production scenarios, such as the decrease in the relative number of single-authored (SA) papers, have been observed. Thus, the aims of this study are to assess the trend of SA papers in four subareas of biology and also to estimate the year when 0.1 % of papers in these subareas will be SA (considering two adjusted models). The subareas investigated were Ecology, Genetics, Zoology and Botany. Our hypothesis is that all subareas show a decay in the number of SA papers. However, this pattern is more pronounced in subareas that were originally interdisciplinary (Genetics and Ecology) than in disciplinary areas (Zoology and Botany). In fact, SA papers have declined over the years in all subareas of biology, and according to the best model (Akaike Criteria), the first area that will have 0.1 % SA papers is Genetics, followed by Ecology. A partial regression indicates that the decrease in SA papers can be related to the increase in the number of authors and number of citations, suggesting the greater scientific impact of interdisciplinary research. However, other variables (e.g., political, linguistic and behavioral) can contribute to the decrease in SA papers. We lastly conclude that the number of SA papers in all subareas of biology in the coming years might continue decreasing and becoming rare, perhaps even to the point of extinction (to use a very common term in biology). In addition, all subareas of biology have become more interdisciplinary, combining the knowledge of various authors (and perhaps authors from different areas).

The list of the most influential references over the period 1960-2005 is dominated by contributions from economics (particularly ecological economics) and environmental science, but includes many other disciplines such as urban planning, political sciences and sociology. References are also made to policy documents such as ""Agenda 21"", one of the main outcomes of the Rio Summit in 1992.

Citation distributions for the US, the European Union (EU), and the Rest of the World are evaluated using a pair of high- and low-impact indicators, as well as the mean citation rate (MCR). The dataset consists of 3.6 million articles published in 1998-2002 with a common 5-year citation window. The analysis is carried at a low aggregation level, namely, the 219 sub-fields identified with the Web of Science categories distinguished by Thomson Scientific. The problems posed by international co-authorship and the multiple assignments of articles to sub-fields are solved following a multiplicative strategy. We find that, although the EU has more publications than the US in 113 out of 219 sub-fields, the US is ahead of the EU in 189 sub-fields in terms of the high-impact indicator, and in 163 sub-fields in terms of the low-impact indicator.

It is argued that the types of problems confronted by an innovation system, and in turn its dynamics of change, are imprinted on the nature of the underlying knowledge bases. The latter is operationalized through the construction of co-citation networks from scientific publications. We endow these co-citation networks with directionality through the allocation of a particular problem, drawn from a 'problem space' for nanomaterials, to each network node. By analyzing the longitudinal, structural and cognitive changes undergone by these problem-attached networks, we attempt to infer the nature of the paths of change of emerging nanotechnological innovation systems.

As such, most contributions presume a clear understanding of what constitutes the organization in the first place. To our opinion however, such ""a-priorism"" is at least awkward, given that even in specialist fields there is no clear understanding of what constitutes the organization. The main argument of this paper holds that performing organization level research in scientometrics can only proceed by taking a pragmatic stance on the constitution of the organization. As such, we argue that performing organization level research in scientometrics (i) requires both authoritative ""objective"" and non-authoritative ""subjective"" background knowledge, (ii) involves non-logic practices that can be more or less theoretically informed, and (iii) depends crucially upon the general aim of the research endeavor in which the organization is taken as a basic unit of analysis.

As long as two references are cited by the same article, they are retreated equally regardless the distance between where citations appear in the article. Little is known about what additional insights into citation and co-citation behaviours one might gain from studying distributions of co-citation in terms of such proximity. How are citations distributed in an article? What insights does the proximity of co-citation provide? In this article, the proximity of a pair of co-cited reference is defined as the nearest instance of the co-citation relation in text. We investigate the proximity of co-citation in full text of scientific publications at four levels, namely, the sentence level, the paragraph level, the section level, and the article level. We conducted four studies of co-citation patterns in the full text of articles published in 22 open access journals from BioMed Central. First, we compared the distributions of co-citation instances at four proximity levels in journal articles to the traditional article-level co-citation counts. Second, we studied the distributions of co-citations of various proximities across organizational sections in articles. Third, the distribution of co-citation proximity in different co-citation frequency groups is investigated. Fourth, we identified the occurrences of co-citations at different proximity levels with reference to the corresponding traditional co-citation network. The results show that (1) the majority of co-citations are loosely coupled at the article level, (2) a higher proportion of sentence-level co-citations is found in high co-citation frequencies than in low co-citation frequencies, (3) tightly coupled sentence-level co-citations not only preserve the essential structure of the corresponding traditional co-citation network but also form a much smaller subset of the entire co-citation instances typically considered by traditional co-citation analysis.

Research publications, the most cherished output of science, provides robust evidence of this changing landscape. The global publication share of advanced scientific countries is decreasing with significant rise in publication share of China and also of other emerging economies such as India, South Korea, and Brazil. Their publications though are still lagging in global reception as measured through citations. However, with increasing international collaboration and publishing in promising areas and high impact journals, the citation reception of their papers is increasing. Indian publication growth is much behind China whose growth has been dramatic! However, India's emergence is interesting as from a leading country among developing economies in scientific publications till early 1980s, her publication growth exhibited sharp decline in the late 1980s. Only from 1995 onwards India started making an assertion in the global publication race and in some promising areas of high relevance such as nanotechnology her publication growth has been impressive. India to a large extent epitomises the scientific activity of emerging economies. Thus through the lens of India's publication trend, the paper underscores the changing global landscape of science.

We employ a manual human-coding approach to classify book reviews in the field of history based on reviewers' assessments of a book author's scholarly credibility (SC) and writing style (WS). In total, 100 book reviews were selected from the American Historical Review and coded for their positive/negative valence on these two dimensions. Most were coded as positive (68% for SC and 47% for WS), and there was also a small positive correlation between SC and WS (r=0.2). We then constructed a classifier, combining both manual design and machine learning, to categorize sentiment-based sentences in history book reviews. The machine classifier produced a matched accuracy (matched to the human coding) of approximately 75% for SC and 64% for WS. WS was found to be more difficult to classify by machine than SC because of the reviewers' use of more subtle language. With further training data, a machine-learning approach could be useful for automatically classifying a large number of history book reviews at once. Weighted megacitations can be especially valuable if they are used in conjunction with regular book/journal citations, and libcitations (i.e., library holding counts) for a comprehensive assessment of a book/monograph's scholarly impact.",0.39,18,2014,3,238,0,15,13,3,42,706,15

To support the growing complexity of search tasks, researchers in the field of information developed and explored a range of approaches that extend the traditional ad hoc retrieval paradigm. Among these approaches, personalized search systems and exploratory search systems attracted many followers. Personalized search explored the power of artificial intelligence techniques to provide tailored search results according to different user interests, contexts, and tasks. In contrast, exploratory search capitalized on the power of human intelligence by providing users with more powerful interfaces to support the search process. As these approaches are not contradictory, we believe that they can re-enforce each other.

The typical example used is the landmark research paper by Novoselov et al. (Science 306(5696): 666-669, 2004) concerning graphene. After an initial accumulation of theoretical knowledge about graphene over a period of 50 years this publication of the discovery of a method to produce graphene had an immediate and significant impact on the R&D community; it provides a link between theory, experimental verification, and new technological applications. The publication of this landmark discovery marks a sharp rise in the number of scholarly publications, and not much later an increase in the number of filings for related patent applications. Noticeable within 2 years after publication is an above average influx of researchers and of organisations. Changes in the structure of co-citation term maps point to renewed interest from theoretical physicists. The analysis uncovered criteria that can help in identifying at early stage potential breakthroughs that link science and technology.",0.38,8,2015,5,247,2.084,18,22,2,14,70,6

Coalitions and consortia are formed among universities, companies and research institutes to apply for research grants and to perform joint projects. In such a competitive environment, individual institutes may be strategic partners or competitors. Measures to determine partner importance have practical applications such as comparison and rating of competitors, reputation evaluation or performance evaluation of companies and institutes. Many network-centric metrics exist to measure the important of individuals or companies in social and collaborative networks. Here we present a novel context-based metric to measure the importance of partners in scientific collaboration networks. Well-established graph models such as the notion of hubs and authorities provide the basis for this work and are systematically extended to a flexible, context-aware network importance measure.

We argue that journal impact, even calculated in a sufficiently advanced way, becomes important in evaluation practices based on bibliometric analysis only at an aggregate level. In the relation between average journal impact and actual citation impact of groups, the influence of research performance is substantial. Top-performance as well as lower performance groups publish in more or less the same range of journal impact values, but top-performance groups are, on average, more successful in the entire range of journal impact. We find that for the high field citation-density groups a larger size implies a lower average journal impact. For groups in the low field citation-density regions however a larger size implies a considerably higher average journal impact. Finally, we found that top-performance groups have relatively less self-citations than the lower performance groups and this fraction is decreasing with journal impact.",0.37,15,2012,4,180,2.133,12,13,1,132,7223,46

With the explosive growth of the number of scientific resources in distributed research institutions in recent years, effectively mapping different SCSs, especially heterogeneous SCSs that categorize different kinds of scientific resources, is becoming an increasingly challenging problem for facilitating information interoperability and networking scientific resources. To effectively realize the heterogeneous SCSs mapping, we design a novel multi-faceted method to measure the similarity between two classes based on three important facets, namely descriptors, individuals, and semantic neighborhood. Particularly, the proposed approach leverages a hybrid method combining statistical learning, semantic analysis and structure analysis for effective measurement with the exploitation of symmetric Tversky's index, WordNet dictionary and the Hungarian Algorithm. The method has been evaluated based on two main SCSs that need mapping for information management and policy-making in NSFC, and shown satisfying results.

In order to check the usefulness of this database for bibliometric analysis, and especially research evaluation, a novel approach is introduced. Instead of names of authors or institutions, a webometric analysis of academic web domains is performed. The bibliographic records for 225 top level web domains (TLD), 19,240 university and 6,380 research centres institutional web domains have been collected from the Google Scholar database.

To address this problem, we derive a hybrid approach based on authors' collaboration patterns and topological features of collaborative networks. Our results show that the combination of strategies, in most cases, performs better than the traditional approach which disregards topological features. We also show that the main factor accounting for the improvement in the discriminability of homonymous authors is the average shortest path length. Finally, we show that it is possible to predict the weighting associated to each strategy compounding the hybrid system by examining the discrimination obtained from the traditional analysis of collaboration patterns.

What are the suitable quantitative indicators to measure the diversity of a researcher's scientific career? We propose two entropy-based metrics to measure a researcher's choice of research topics. Experiments with large computer science bibliographic dataset reveal that there is a strong correlation between the diversity of the career of a researcher and her success in scientific research in terms of the number of citations. We observe that while most of the researchers are biased toward either adopting diverse research fields or concentrating on very few fields, a majority of the prominent researchers tend to follow a typical ""scatter-gather"" policy - although their entire careers are immensely diverse with different types of fields selected at different time periods, they remain focused primarily in at most one or two fields at any particular time point of their career.

Second, the Dynamic CTM (DCTM) can capture the dynamic features of communities and topics based on the Bernoulli distribution that leverages the temporal continuity between consecutive timestamps.

This study uses bibliometric statistics to shed further light on the global landscape of citation index publications with special focus on China and the USA. The analysis explores 31 years of the TRS (Thomson Reuters Scientific) database, spanning the 1980-2010 period. Based on this study, the USA maintains global dominance for both WOK (Web of Knowledge) and WOS (Web of Science) TRS publications. Although China ranks a distant second for WOK, it lags behind five other nations for WOS publications. China's scientific base needs further restructuring for greater global visibility. Emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa are fast rising in the global ranks for WOK/WOS publications. China may already be leading the world in some publication attributes, although it could take several more decades to catch up with the USA in others. Normalizations of the publications with population, PTE (population with tertiary education) and GDP (gross domestic product) put small/low-population countries in the global lead. However, countries such as Canada, Greenland, Iceland and Sweden still rank high for most of these publication attributes. Furthermore, WOS per WOK analysis shows that small and/or economically weak countries place greater emphasis on WOS publications. This is particularly visible for countries in Africa and South America. Despite the addition of a large number of indigenous Chinese journals to the TRS database, prediction analysis suggests that China's desire to surpass the USA could be delayed for several decades. In the race for the next-generation scientific superpower, however, China not only needs to sustain substantial investments in research and development, but also requires restructuring of its research industry. This is especially critical for data readiness, availability and accessibility to the scientific community, and radical implementations of research recommendations.",0.3,26,2013,5,335,2.274,18,20,2,37,804,17

Agglomerations of bibliographically coupled publications with a common knowledge base are identified and graphically represented by a density function of publications per area unit. The research fronts become visible if publications with similar vectors of common citations are associated and visualized as an ensemble in a three dimensional graphical representation as a mountain scenery measured with the help of a spatial density. Knowledge bases were calculated in the same way.

Co-word analysis (CWA), a popular method for technology analysis, encompasses (1) defining a set of keyword or key phrase patterns which are represented in technology-dependent terms, (2) generating a network that codifies the relations between occurrences of keywords or key phrases, and (3) identifying specific trends from the network. However, defining the set of keyword or key phrase patterns heavily relies on effort of experts, who may be expensive or unavailable. Furthermore defining keyword or key phrase patterns of new or emerging technology areas may be a difficult task even for experts. To solve the limitation in CWA, this research adopts a property-function based approach. The property is a specific characteristic of a product, and is usually described using adjectives; the function is a useful action of a product, and is usually described using verbs. Properties and functions represent the innovation concepts of a system, so they show innovation directions in a given technology. The proposed methodology automatically extracts properties and functions from patents using natural language processing. Using properties and functions as nodes, and co-occurrences as links, an invention property-function network (IPFN) can be generated. Using social network analysis, the methodology analyzes technological implications of indicators in the IPFN.

The disadvantage of using boosting algorithms for text categorization (TC) is the vast number of features that are generated using the traditional Bag-of-Words (BOW) text representation, which dramatically increases the computational complexity. In this paper, an alternative text representation method using topic modeling for enhancing and accelerating multi-label boosting algorithms is concerned. An extensive empirical experimental comparison of eight multi-label boosting algorithms using topic-based and BOW representation methods was undertaken. For the evaluation, three well-known multi-label TC datasets were used. Furthermore, to justify boosting algorithms performance, three well-known instance-based multi-label algorithms were involved in the evaluation. For completely credible evaluations, all algorithms were evaluated using their native software tools, except for data formats and user settings. The experimental results demonstrated that the topic-based representation significantly accelerated all algorithms and slightly enhanced the classification performance, especially for near-balanced and balanced datasets. For the imbalanced dataset, BOW representation led to the best performance. The MP-Boost algorithm is the most efficient and effective algorithm for imbalanced datasets using BOW representation. For topic-based representation, AdaBoost.MH with meta base learners, Hamming Tree (AdaMH-Tree) and Product (AdaMH-Product) achieved the best performance; however, with respect to the computational time, these algorithms are the slowest overall. Moreover, the results indicated that topic-based representation is more significant for instance-based algorithms; nevertheless, boosting algorithms, such as MP-Boost, AdaMH-Tree and AdaMH-Product, notably exceed their performance.",0.28,7,2015,7,279,0.878,13,15,3,8,110,6

This metric assumes that a citation is a positive indicator of the quality of the cited work. This assumption is not always true since citations serve many purposes. As a result, citation count is an indirect and imprecise measure of impact. If instrumental citations could be reliably distinguished from non-instrumental ones, this would readily improve the performance of existing citation-based metrics by excluding the non-instrumental citations. A citation was operationally defined as instrumental if either of the following was true: the hypothesis of the citing work was motivated by the cited work, or the citing work could not have been executed without the cited work. This work investigated the feasibility of developing computer models for automatically classifying citations as instrumental or non-instrumental. Instrumental citations were manually labeled, and machine learning models were trained on a combination of content and bibliometric features. The experimental results indicate that models based on content and bibliometric features are able to automatically classify instrumental citations with high predictivity (AUC = 0.86). Additional experiments using independent hold out data and prospective validation show that the models are generalizeable and can handle unseen cases.

China has made great progress in paper production and citation impact, and Taiwan and Korea have experienced a rapid growth in patents over the past years. The degree of concentration dramatically decreases when the data from the United States are excluded, indicating the effects of the U.S.'s participation on the concentration. Patents show a higher degree of concentration than papers. With time-varying aspects taken into consideration, the study indicates that the degree of concentration of papers and patents has gradually decreased over time.

The first, a diary study (p=68), provides descriptions of Twitter information needs (n=117) and important meta-data from active study participants. The second data set was established by collecting first-person descriptions of search behavior (n=388) tweeted by twitter users themselves (p=381) and complements the first data set by providing similar descriptions from a more plentiful source. The results of our analyses reveal numerous characteristics of Twitter search that differentiate it from more commonly studied search domains, such as web search. The findings also shed light on some of the difficulties users encounter.

The two indexes are superior to the widely used h index (Hirsch, 2005), as they preserve all its valuable characteristics and try to overcome one of its shortcomings, i.e. that it uses only a fraction of the information contained in a scientist's citations profile and, as a result, it is defined over the set of positive integers and does not show a sufficiently fine 'granularity' to allow a fully satisfactory ranking of scientists. This problem is particularly acute in many areas of Social Sciences and Humanities, where scientific productivity and citation practices typically yield fewer citations per paper and, as a consequence, are characterized by 'structurally' lower values of the h index. Both the indexes proposed are defined over R+, their integer part is equal to the scientist's h index and they fall in the right-open interval [h, h+1). While the h index is influenced only by part of the citations received by a scientist's most-cited publications, the k index takes into account all the citations received by her most-cited publications and the w index accounts for the citations received by the entire set of her publications.

The study of these motivations has led to the introduction of different theories like normative theory and social constructive theory of citing behavior. Using the social constructive approach to citing behavior, this research introduces citing conformity whereby some authors' social, personal or non professional citing behaviors are determined by societal pressure. This is explained at three levels namely; normative, informational and identification. This paper aims to design, validate and determine the reliability of a questionnaire to measure citing conformity at these three levels. In order to devise the instrument, a questionnaire with 45 items was preliminarily designed. After face validity of the questionnaire had been determined by ten scholars, data was gathered. 150 Iranian authors with at least two articles indexed in Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) or Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) during the period 2001-2010 were selected using systematic random allocation and were asked to fill out the questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis was used to analyze the data. Factor analysis was administered using principal components analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation, eigenvalue more than one, and factor loading 0.45 to extract three factors. Out of 45 items, 11 were deleted by the software due to low factor loading. The remaining 34 items were retained and constitute tree factors: normative (13 items), informational (13 items), and identification (8 items). KMO coefficient test was 0.726 and Bartlett sphericity index was 2431.91 (P < 0.0001) which proved the sufficiency of sample size and the reliability of the test. Cronbach's alpha was employed to determine the reliability of this instrument. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for normative, informational and identification conformities was 0.86, 0.81 and 0.85 respectively. Therefore, the reliability of all the factors was acceptable with approximately high coefficients. As the Cronbach's alpha coefficients convey, the reliability of all factors was acceptable. The development of a citing conformity instrument at normative, informational and identification levels, provides a scale to measure authors' citing behavior in social, personal or non professional aspects according to the above mentioned psychological variables (normative, informational and identification conformities).

However, not all citations are equally relevant to the target article. This paper presents an approach to identify the most relevant citation(s). To this end, the Normalized Similarity Index (NSI) is proposed to quantify the similarity between the source and target of a citation base on the co-citations and references shared by them. To validate the method, NSI was calculated for five citation networks and was compared with the peer review grades for the relevancy between the source and the target articles. The results showed a significant correlation between the NSI ranks and those of peer review. Also, combined linkage (CL) and weighted direct citation (WDC) were calculated from the same data. According to the results of comparison between the NSI with other similarity measures, in most cases, NSI did better than others at reproducing the peer rankings. Our principal conclusion is that the NSI can be used to prioritize the citations of given highly cited article, and represent knowledge flow from the target article. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Our aim is to show the main mathematical properties of this class of impact measuring tools, that hold as consequences of their mathematical structure and does not depend on the definition of any given index nowadays in use.

To perform this task, a similarity-based algorithm that employs the similarities of nodes to find links is a very popular solution. However, when calculating the similarity between two nodes, most of the similarity-based algorithms only focus on the contributions of paths connecting these two nodes but ignore the influences of these two nodes themselves. Therefore, their results are not accurate enough. In this paper, a novel similarity index, called Scop, is proposed for link prediction. By directly defining the contributions of paths to their end nodes and the contributions of end nodes themselves, Scop not only distinguishes the contributions of different paths but also integrates the contributions of end nodes. Hence, Scop can obtain better performance on accuracy.

The aim of this study is to suggest a new approach to the journal impact factor on a wider scale, i.e., from the viewpoint of citing journals. I studied how citations (references) given by JCR journals contribute to the 2-year and 5-year journal impact factors (JIF). To do so, data were obtained from the 2011 edition of JCR (Science Edition) available for universities in Spain, and the citing journal matrix for each journal was used. This matrix records the number of times articles published in other journals (cited journals) were cited in a given journal (citing journal) in 2011. The results showed that a set of 50 journals produced about 15% of all references that contributed to the 2-year JIF. Similarly, a set of 50 journals produced about 13% of all references that contributed to the 5-year JIF. A Bradford-like plot was obtained by plotting the cumulative number of references that contributed to the 2-year and 5-year JIF against the cumulative number of citing journals. The distribution of journals according to the number and percentage of references they contributed to the 2-year and 5-year JIF showed peaks. A rank-order distribution of references that contributed to the 2-year and 5 year JIF was obtained with a previously described empirical two-exponent equation. Based on the maximum contribution to the 2-year JIF of different 2-year rolling reference windows, the second rolling window (references to articles published 2 and 3 years before 2011) made the greatest contribution to impact in 41% of journals.

Existing manual subject indexing systems generally produce binary outcomes for whether or not to assign an indexing term. This does not sufficiently reflect the extent to which the indexing terms are associated with the documents. On the other hand, the idea of probabilistic or weighted indexing was proposed a long time ago and has seen success in capturing uncertainties in the automatic indexing process. One hurdle to overcome in implementing weighted indexing in manual subject indexing systems is the practical burden that could be added to the already intensive indexing process. This study proposes a method to infer automatically the associations between subject terms and documents through text mining. By uncovering the connections between MeSH descriptors and document text, we are able to derive the weights of MeSH descriptors manually assigned to documents. Our initial results suggest that the inference method is feasible and promising.

We advance this line of research by proposing an enhanced Random Subspace method, POS-RS, for sentiment classification based on part-of-speech analysis. Unlike existing Random Subspace methods using a single subspace rate to control the diversity of base learners, POS-RS employs two important parameters, i.e. content lexicon subspace rate and function lexicon subspace rate, to control the balance between the accuracy and diversity of base learners. Ten publicly available sentiment data-sets were investigated to verify the effectiveness of proposed method. Empirical results reveal that POS-RS achieves the best performance through reducing bias and variance simultaneously compared to the base learner, i.e., Support Vector Machine. These results illustrate that POS-RS can be used as a viable method for sentiment classification and has the potential of being successfully applied to other text classification problems.

There is much less development of nanotechnology research in central and western China. Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong are among the leading Chinese regions for international nanotechnology research collaboration.

Our proposal is applied to a database of homogeneous scientists made up of 131 full professors of statistics employed in Italian universities.

This study evaluates that assertion through a set of simple and multiple regressions covering seven social science disciplines: anthropology, communication, economics, education, library and information science, psychology, and sociology. Contrary to expectations. AI underestimates 5IF (five-year Impact Factor) for journals in science-related subfields such as scientific communication, science education, scientometrics, biopsychology, and medical sociology. journals in these subfields have low AI scores relative to their 5IF values.

In South Korea, particularly, not only the numbers of publications have increased, but there is a noticeable change in the composition of scientific and engineering activities. This paper notes the most of the research on the knowledge production of advanced countries, along with a handful of studies about the knowledge production of latecomers. Recent changes in the patterns of knowledge production in latecomer countries provoke the deeper understanding about the underlying mechanisms of ongoing change. Therefore, this paper explores the patterns of knowledge production activities in latecomers by analyzing scientific and engineering capabilities using empirical evidence from Korea. The results suggest that the patterns of accumulation of knowledge production in Korea gradually evolved from engineering to scientific activities. Important policy implications can be drawn from the findings for supporting scientific and engineering research activity in the latecomers in general and NIEs in particular.",0.15,16,2013,4,184,2.274,8,22,2,24,342,12

Method Queried literature databases using an extensive online register of academic psychologists in the German-speaking countries, obtaining valid data for 85 % (N = 1742) of the population of interest. Findings Skewed distributions for publications and citations; maximum number of German-language (=native) publications much higher than maximum number of English-language publications; relatively large part of population publishing almost exclusively in German; publication count predictable by academic status, gender, department size, and quota of senior researchers; citation count predictable by publication count, status, department size, and quota of senior researchers; department characteristics interact with individual characteristics to produce specific conditions under which publication count and citation count are higher or lower than expected: combination of female gender, small department size and large quota of senior researchers is associated with particularly increased publication count; female gender and large department size are associated with decreased publication count; high publication count, large department size and low quota of senior researchers are associated with increased citation count; low publication count and large quota of senior researchers are associated with decreased citation count.

In this paper, we analyze the changing communications structure in order to investigate the patterns associated with the final stages of organizational crisis. Organizational crisis has been defined as organizational mortality, organizational death, organizational exit, bankruptcy, decline, retrenchment and failure to characterize various forms of organizational crisis. We draw on theoretical perspectives on organizational crisis proposed by social network analysts and other sociologists to test 5 key propositions on the changes in the network communication structure associated with organizational crisis: (1) a few actors, who are prominent or more active, will become central during the organizational crisis period; (2) reciprocity within the organizational communication network will increase during crisis period; (3) organizational communication network becomes less transitive as organizations experience crisis; (4) number of cliques increases in a communication network as organizations are going through crisis; and (5) communication network becomes increasingly centralized as organizations go through crisis.

In this paper, we study the problem of identifying and rating review aspects, which is the fundamental task in aspect level sentiment analysis. Previous review aspect analysis methods seldom consider entity or rating but only 2-tuples, i.e., head and modifier pair, e.g., in the phrase ""nice room"", ""room"" is the head and ""nice"" is the modifier. To solve this problem, we novelly present a Quad-tuple Probability Latent Semantic Analysis (QPLSA), which incorporates entity and its rating together with the 2-tuples into the PLSA model. Specifically, QPLSA not only generates fine-granularity aspects, but also captures the correlations between words and ratings. We also develop two novel prediction approaches, the Quad-tuple Prediction (from the global perspective) and the Expectation Prediction (from the local perspective). For evaluation, systematic experiments show that: Quad-tuple PLSA outperforms 2-tuple PLSA significantly on both aspect identification and aspect rating prediction for publication datasets. Moreover, for aspect rating prediction, QPLSA shows significant superiority over state-of-the-art baseline methods. Besides, the Quad-tuple Prediction and the Expectation Prediction also show their strong ability in aspect rating on different datasets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we would like to understand if and how collaborations at the author (micro) level impact collaboration patterns among institutions (meso) and countries (macro). All 2,541 papers (articles, proceedings papers, and reviews) published in the international journal Scientometrics from 1978-2010 are analyzed and visualized across the different levels and the evolving collaboration networks are animated over time. Studying the three levels in isolation we gain a number of insights: (1) USA, Belgium, and England dominated the publications in Scientometrics throughout the 33-year period, while the Netherlands and Spain were the subdominant countries; (2) the number of institutions and authors increased over time, yet the average number of papers per institution grew slowly and the average number of papers per author decreased in recent years; (3) a few key institutions, including Univ Sussex, KHBO, Katholieke Univ Leuven, Hungarian Acad Sci, and Leiden Univ, have a high centrality and betweenness, acting as gatekeepers in the collaboration network; (4) early key authors (Lancaster FW, Braun T, Courtial JP, Narin F, or VanRaan AFJ) have been replaced by current prolific authors (such as Rousseau R or Moed HF). Comparing results across the three levels reveals that results from one level might propagate to the next level, e.g., top rankings of a few key single authors can not only have a major impact on the ranking of their institution but also lead to a dominance of their country at the country level; movement of prolific authors among institutions can lead to major structural changes in the institution networks.

In recent years, it has become more and more common to classify all patent documents using the International Patent Classification (IPC), a complex hierarchical classification system comprised of eight sections, 128 classes, 648 subclasses, about 7200 main groups, and approximately 72,000 subgroups. So far, however, no patent categorization method has been developed that can classify patents down to the subgroup level (the bottom level of the IPC). Therefore, this paper presents a novel categorization method, the three phase categorization (TPC) algorithm, which classifies patents down to the subgroup level with reasonable accuracy. The experimental results for the TPC algorithm, using the WIPO-alpha collection, indicate that our classification method can achieve 36.07% accuracy at the subgroup level.

Towards this goal, we collected 21 million tags (1.2 million unique terms) from Delicious and developed an unsupervised statistical algorithm that classifies such tags by applying a word space model adapted to the folksonomy space. Our algorithm analyses the co-occurrence network of tags to a target tag and exploits graph-based metrics for their classification. We validated its outcomes against a reference classification made by humans on a limited number of terms in three separate tests.

In this paper, an algorithm is proposed, referred to top k RHS (Rank Hash Similarity), in which a ranking loss function is designed for learning a hash function. The hash function is hypothesized to be made up of I binary classifiers. The issue of learning a hash function can be formulated as a task of learning I binary classifiers.

It was found that due to overdispersion in most response variables, the negative binomial regression model often seems to be more appropriate for informetric datasets than the Poisson and generalized Poisson regression models. Also, the regression analyses showed that linear regression model predicted some negative values for five of the nine response variables modelled, and for all the response variables, it performed worse than both the negative binomial and lognormal regression models when either Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used as the measure of goodness of fit statistics. The negative binomial regression model performed significantly better than the lognormal regression model for four of the response variables while the lognormal regression model performed significantly better than the negative binomial regression model for two of the response variables but there was no significant difference in the performance of the two models for the remaining three response variables.

In many cases, a seminal discovery serves as the driving force underlying any given peak. Importantly, the results from a RPYS analyses are represented on their own distinct scales, the bounds of which vary considerably across analyses. This makes comparing years of punctuated impact across multiple RPYS analyses problematic. In this paper, we propose a data transformation and visualization technique that resolves this challenge. Specifically, using a rank-order normalization procedure, we compress the results of multiple RPYS analyses into a single, consistent rank scale that clearly highlights years of punctuated impact across RPYS analyses. We suggest that rank transformation increases the effectiveness of this scientometric technique to reveal the scope of historical impact of seminal works by allowing researchers to simultaneously consider results from multiple RPYS analyses.

Storytelling-based semantic path analysis can be viewed as relation navigation for bio-entities that are semantically close to each other, and reveals insight into how a series of entity pairs is organized, and how it can be harnessed to explain seemingly unrelated connections.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that centrality in national networks (coreness) is associated with organizational characteristics, reflecting that interlinking is motivated by access to resources and the status of the organizations concerned, and that national policies impact network structures by influencing the level of inequality in the distribution of resources and status. Finally, we show that, as an outcome of the core-periphery structure, the strength of ties between two HEIs is largely determined by their individual coreness, while the impact of distance is too small-scale to alter the network structure generated by organizational attributes.

Statistical analyses verify that each group of journals has a distinct author population. Those who publish in predatory journals are, for the most part, young and inexperienced researchers from developing countries. We believe that economic and sociocultural conditions in these developing countries have contributed to the differences found in authorship between predatory and nonpredatory journals.",0.12,147,2015,3,136,1.864,5,12,6,47,880,18

The proposed method solves the shortcoming of the keyword-based approach to identification of technology trends, i.e., that it cannot represent how technologies are used or for what purpose. The concept of function provides information on how a technology is used and how it interacts with other technologies; the keyword-based approach does not provide such information. The proposed method uses an SAO model and represents ""key concept'' instead of ""key word''. We present a procedure that formulates an SAO network by using SAO models extracted from patent documents, and a method that applies actor network theory to analyze technology implications of the SAO network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAO network this paper presents a case study of patents related to Polymer Electrolyte Membrane technology in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells.",0.12,61,2011,7,164,1.966,23,21,5,27,604,12

This methodology employs an adaptation of the ProKnow-C for selection of publications and the InOrdinatio, which is an index to rank by relevance the works selected. This index crosses the three main factors under evaluation in a paper: impact factor, year of publication and number of citations. When applying the equation, the researchers identify among the works selected the most relevant ones to be in their bibliographic portfolio.

In this paper we examined the aquaculture literature using bibliometrics and computational semantics methods (latent semantic analysis, topic model and co-citation analysis) to identify the main themes and trends in research. We analysed bibliographic information and abstracts of 14,308 scientific articles on aquaculture recorded in Scopus. Both the latent semantic analysis and the topic model indicate that the broad themes of research on aquaculture are related to genetics and reproduction, growth and physiology, farming systems and environment, nutrition, water quality, and health. The topic model gives an estimate of the relevance of these research themes by single articles, authors, research institutions, species and time. With the co-citation analysis it was possible to identify more specific research fronts, which are attracting high number of co-citations by the scientific community. The largest research fronts are related to probiotics, benthic sediments, genomics, integrated aquaculture and water treatment. In terms of temporal evolution, some research fronts such as probiotics, genomics, sea-lice, and environmental impacts from cage aquaculture, are still expanding while others, such as mangroves and shrimp farming, benthic sediments, are gradually losing weight. While bibliometric methods do not necessarily provide a measure of output or impact of research activities, they proved useful for mapping a research area, identifying the relevance of themes in the scientific literature and understanding how research fronts evolve and interact. By using different methodological approaches the study is taking advantage of the strengths of each method in mapping the research on aquaculture and showing in the meantime possible limitations and some directions for further improvements.",0.12,35,2012,6,321,2.133,11,17,3,23,728,13

In contrast, fractional credit, which ignored the byline hierarchy by allocating equal credit to all coauthors, explained less than 40% of the variation in the empirical dataset. The nearly 60% discrepancy in explanatory power between fractional and harmonic credit was accounted for by equalizing bias associated with the omission of relevant information about differential coauthor contribution. Including an additional parameter to describe a continuum of intermediate formulas between fractional and harmonic provided a negligible or negative gain in predictive accuracy. By comparison, two parametric models from the bibliometric literature both had an explanatory capacity of approximately 80%. In conclusion, the results indicate that the harmonic formula provides a parsimonious solution to the problem of quantifying the byline hierarchy. Harmonic credit allocation also accommodates specific indications of departures from the basic byline hierarchy, such as footnoted information stating that some or all coauthors have contributed equally or indicating the presence of a senior author.

Results show that tiny and sparse networks - characterized by a high Betweenness centrality and a high Average path length - achieved more citations per document than dense and compact networks described by a high Clustering coefficient and a high Average degree. According to disciplinary differences, Mathematics, Social Sciences and Economics & Business are the disciplines with more sparse and tiny networks; while Physics, Engineering and Geosciences are characterized by dense and crowded networks.

According to the bibliometric analysis, the top-ranked institution is Middle East Technical University, and the top-ranked scholar is Ayse Basar Bener (formerly with Bogazici University and now with Ryerson University in Canada). The analysis reveals other important findings and presents a set of implications for the Turkish SE community and stakeholders (e.g., funding agencies and decision makers) such as the followings: (1) Turkey produces only about 0.49 % of the world-wide SE knowledge, as measured by the number of papers in Scopus, which is very negligible unfortunately. To take a more active role in the global SE community, the Turkish SE community has to increase their outputs. (2) We notice a lack of diversity in the general SE spectrum, e.g., we noticed very little focus on requirements engineering, software maintenance and evolution, and architecture. This denotes the need to further diversification in SE research topics in Turkey. (3) In total, 89 papers in the pool (30.8 % of the total) are internationally-authored SE papers. Having a good level of international collaborations is a good sign for the Turkish SE community. The highest international collaborations have been with researchers from United States, Canada and Netherlands. (4) In general, the involvement of industry in SE search is low. All stakeholders (e.g., government, industry and academia) should aim at increasing the level of industry-academia collaboration in the Turkish SE community, (5) Citation to Turkish SE papers, in general, are significantly lower than a set of three representative pools of SE papers. This is an area of concern which needs further investigation, and (6) In general, there is a need to increase both the quantity and quality of the Turkish SE papers, in the global stage.

Although the impact of women's scientific output significantly increases after the fall of the USSR, the gap between both genders remains stable over time for most of the disciplines.

Because of a common focus on communication, these perspectives can be combined as a set of methodologies. Latour's sociology of translations specifies a mechanism for generating variation in relations (associations), whereas Luhmann's systems perspective enables the specification of (functionally different) selection environments such as markets, professional organizations, and political control. Selection environments can be considered as mechanisms of social coordination that can self-organizebeyond the control of human agencyinto regimes in terms of interacting codes of communication. Unlike relatively globalized regimes, technological trajectories are organized locally in landscapes. A resulting duality of structure (Giddens, 1979) between the historical organization of trajectories and evolutionary self-organization at the regime level can be expected to drive innovation cycles. Reflexive translations add a third layer of perspectives to (a) the relational analysis of observable links that shape trajectories and (b) the positional analysis of networks in terms of latent dimensions. These three operations can be studied in a single framework, but using different methodologies. Latour's first-order associations can then be analytically distinguished from second-order translations in terms of requiring other communicative competencies. The resulting operations remain infrareflexively nested, and can therefore be used for innovative reconstructions of previously constructed boundaries.",0.12,12,2014,2,260,0,12,16,2,416,20160,71

The main purpose of using an h-index is to compare the index for different research units (e.g. researchers, journals, etc.) to differentiate their research performance. However the h-index is defined by only comparing citations counts of one's own publications, it is doubtful that the h index alone should be used for reliable comparisons among different research units, like researchers or journals. In this paper we propose a new global h-index (Gh-index), where the publications in the core are selected in comparison with all the publications of the units to be evaluated. Furthermore, we introduce some variants of the Gh-index to address the issue of discrimination power. We show that together with the original h-index, they can be used to evaluate and classify academic journals with some distinct advantages, in particular that they can produce an automatic classification into a number of categories without arbitrary cut-off points. We then carry out an empirical study for classification of operations research and management science (OR/MS) journals using this index, and compare it with other well-known journal ranking results such as the Association of Business Schools (ABS) journal Quality Guide and the Committee of Professors in OR (COPIOR) ranking lists.

Whether the use of these advanced methods, which are often difficult to implement, is warranted depends on whether the accuracy of the most basic disambiguation methods, which only use the author's last name and initials, is sufficient for a particular purpose. We derive realistic estimates for the accuracy of simple, initials-based methods using simulated bibliographic datasets in which the true identities of authors are known. Based on the simulations in five diverse disciplines we find that the first initial method already correctly identifies 97% of authors. An alternative simple method, which takes all initials into account, is typically two times less accurate, except in certain datasets that can be identified by applying a simple criterion. Finally, we introduce a new name-based method that combines the features of first initial and all initials methods by implicitly taking into account the last name frequency and the size of the dataset. This hybrid method reduces the fraction of incorrectly identified authors by 10-30% over the first initial method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For the construction of R&D collaborating networks based on the co-authorship data of 127 institutions in Scopus, this paper proposes four types of collaborations by categorizing network analyses into two dimensions: structural positions (density, efficiency, and betweeness centrality) and the relational characteristics of individual nodes (eigenvector and closeness centralities). To explore the research performance by collaboration type, we employ a data envelopment analysis window analysis of a panel of 23 PRIs over a 10-year period. Comparing the R&D productivities of each group, we find that the PRIs of higher productivity adhere to a cohesive networking strategy, retaining intensive relations with their existing partners. The empirical results suggest that excessively cohesive alliances might end up in 'lock-in' relations, hindering the exploitation of new opportunities for innovation. These findings are implicit in relation to the Korean Government's R&D policies on collaborating strategies to produce sustained research results with the advent of the convergence research era.",0.1,40,2012,5,188,2.133,13,18,4,48,555,13

Two datasets are used: 147,547 papers published between 2000 and 2008 and assigned to 14,379 Canadian university professors affiliated to 508 departments, and all papers indexed in the Web of Science for the same period (N = 8,221,926) assigned to all countries and institutions.

Moreover, the difference between both measures is strongly influenced by the number of papers published as well as by their impact scores: the difference between AoR and RoA is greater for departments, institutions and countries with low RoA scores. Finally, our results show that RoA relative impact indicators do not add up to unity (as they should by definition) at the level of the reference dataset, whereas the AoR does have that property.

However, limited by the methodologies they used, previous scholars can only select part of the RBT literature to conduct the survey work. To eliminate the limitation, this study develops an innovative approach which can handle thousands of articles. This study analyzes a dataset including 2,105 theoretical developments, empirical studies, and review papers to explore the knowledge diffusion path of the RBT. Citation data are used to build the citation network. Main paths are then probed and visualized via social network analysis methodology. To figure out the total picture of the knowledge diffusion path, this study integrates various main path analyses to supplement the traditional approach. The traditional main path analysis investigates the knowledge diffusion from a local view. The global analysis provides a main path from a macro view.

This paper proposes an alternative definition of association between variables subject to an order restriction that eliminates their structural relation and reverts to the conventional definition when applied to variables that are not subject to order restrictions. This alternative definition is illustrated in a number of theoretical cases and it is also applied to empirical data involving scientometric indices subject to an order restriction.

This trend is relevant, as for a long period up until 1996, Africa's share of the world scientific output remained below 1.5 %. The propensity to publish in the continent has risen particularly fast since 2004, suggesting that a possible take-off of African science is taking place. This paper highlights that, in parallel with this most recent growth in output, the apparent productivity of African science, as measured by publications to gross domestic product, has risen in recent years to a level above the world average, although, when one looks at the equivalent ratio after it has been normalized by population, there is still a huge gap to overcome. Further it is shown that publications from those few African countries whose scientific communities demonstrate higher levels of specialization and integration in international networks, have a higher impact than the world average. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential applications of the new knowledge that has been produced by African researchers, highlighting that so far, South Africa seems to be the only African country where a reasonable part of that new knowledge seems to be connecting with innovation.",0.09,42,2015,6,229,2.084,8,28,2,6,80,4

In order to explore the evolution process of the innovation system in Korea, this study examines the trends and patterns in collaboration activities among the triple helix actors, such as university, industry, and government (UIG), using co-patent data. The triple helix framework is employed to analyze innovation dynamics within the networks of the bi- and trilateral relations embedded in patent collaborations. The analyses focus on how the triple helix dynamics have been shaped and transformed in the course of development of the innovation system. The results reveal that collaboration activities among UIG largely increased across three developmental phases from 1980 to 2012. In the early periods, strategic R&D alliances between industry and government sector were set up to strengthen enterprises' innovation capabilities. When the Korean large conglomerates, Chaebols, became a dominant driver of domestic innovation activities, the primary agents of the collaborations shifted from industry-government to industry-university. The network analysis shows that university-industry collaboration is the strongest within the triple helix in recent years, followed by industry-government relations and then UIG relations. The tripartite collaboration has emerged with the rise of entrepreneur universities, but its network has rather been weak and inactive.

In other words, there exists a single maximum, referred to as the tipping point, where the retrieval situation is 'ideal' in terms of the F-score. The tipping point thus indicates the optimal number of items to be retrieved, with more or less items resulting in a lower F-score.

Due to the different data sources utilized, a considerable number of missing values appeared in our datasets and various mapping issues required corrections prior to the analysis. Two techniques for handling missing data were applied and the impact of each technique was discussed.

The difference between the maximum correlation for the amount of external research funding with two average indicators and that of the correlation for e-journal use were not significant.

Given their access and in-depth knowledge about local institutions, national ranking systems tend to include a more comprehensive set of indicators. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic comparison of national and global university ranking systems in terms of their indicators, coverage and ranking results. Our findings indicate that national rankings tend to include a larger number of indicators that primarily focus on educational and institutional parameters, whereas global ranking systems tend to have fewer indicators mainly focusing on research performance.

Comparison of average number of pages, average number of references, average number of authors per paper and percentage of single-authored papers between cited and uncited papers shows that no matter the journal, the first three indicators' values for uncited papers are lower, while the values of the fourth indicator are higher, than the corresponding values for cited papers. The fact that almost all uncited authors in a journal published only one paper in this journal illustrates that a journal's uncited authors are the least productive authors in this journal. Yet, productive and highly cited authors also publish uncited papers.

As the search in sentence retrieval is conducted over smaller segments of text than in document retrieval, the problems of data sparsity and exact matching become more critical. Different techniques such as the translation model are also proposed to overcome the word mismatch problem. Our class-based and trained trigger language models, however, use different approaches to this aim and are shown to outperform the exiting models. The class model uses word clustering algorithm to capture term relationships. In this model, we assume a relation between the terms that belong to the same clusters; as a result, they can be substituted when searching for relevant sentences. The trigger model captures pairs of trigger and target words while training on a large corpus. The model considers a relation between a question and a sentence, if a trigger word appears in the question and the sentence contains the corresponding target word. For both proposed models, we introduce different notions of co-occurrence to find word relations. In addition, we study the impact of corpus size and domain on the models. Our experiments on TREC QA collection verify that the proposed model significantly improves the sentence retrieval performance compared to the state-of-the-art translation model.

This problem is addressed by utilizing Hirsch index as a reliable metric of an academic's scientific productivity. Utilizing the dataset, constructed with academic performance indicators of individuals from the Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering Departments, of the Turkish Technical Universities, we demonstrate that academic inbreeding has a negative impact on apparent scientific effectiveness through a negative binomial model. This model appears to be the most suitable one for the dataset which is a type of count data. We report chi-square statistics and likelihood ratio test for the parameter alpha. According to the chi-square statistics the model is significant as a whole. The incidence rate ratio for the variable ""inbreeding'' is estimated to be 0.11 and this ratio tells that, holding all the other factors constant, for the inbred faculty, the h-index is about 89% lower when compared to the non-inbred faculty. Furthermore, there exists negative and statistically significant correlation with an individual's productivity and the percentage of inbred faculty members at the very same department.

Further, in methodological perspective, the approaches should be able to synthetically consider the most recent technological information, the direct and hidden impacts among technologies, and the relative impacts of the focal technology in globally-linked technological relationship from the overall perspective. However, most previous studies based patent citation networks are insufficient for these requirements. As a remedy, we present a combined approach for constructing a technology impact network and identifying the impact and intermediating capability of technology areas from the perspective of a national technology system. To construct and analyze the technology impact network, our method integrates three network techniques: patent co-classification (PCA), decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and social network analysis (SNA). The advantages of the proposed method are threefold. First, it identifies the directed technological knowledge flows from the most recent patents, by employing PCA. Second, the proposed network contains both the direct and indirect impacts among different technology areas, by applying the DEMATEL method. Third, using SNA, the method can analyze the characteristics of the technologies in terms of the comprehensive impacts and the potential brokerage capabilities.

Here we hypothesize that impact-factor boosting (unethical behavior documented previously in several underperforming journals) should not be considered as exceptional, but that it affects even the top-tier journals. We performed a citation analysis of documents recently published in 11 prominent general science and biomedical journals. In these journals, only 12 to 79% of what they publish was considered original research, whereas editorial materials alone constituted 11 to 44% of the total document types published. Citations to commissioned opinion articles comprised 3 to 15% of the total citations to the journals within 3 postpublication years, with even a higher share occurring during the first postpublication year. An additional 4 to 15% of the citations were received by the journals from commissioned opinion articles published in other journals. Combined, the parallel world of uncitable documents was responsible for up to 30% of the total citations to the top-tier journals, with the highest values found for medical science journals (New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, and the Lancet) and lower values found for the Science, Nature, and Cell series journals. Self-citations to some of the top-tier journals reach values higher than the total citation counts accumulated by papers in most of the Web of Science-indexed journals. Most of the self-citations were generated by commissioned opinion articles.

Patent citation analysis is easy to use, but fundamentally has two main limitations: (1) new patents tend to be less cited than old ones and may miss citations to contemporary patents; (2) citation-based analysis cannot be used for patents in databases which do not require citations. Naturally, citation-based analysis tends to underestimate the importance of new patents and may not work in rapidly-evolving industries in which technology life-cycles are shortening and new inventions are increasingly patented worldwide. As a remedy, this paper proposes a patent network based on semantic patent analysis using subject-action-object (SAO) structures. SAO structures represent the explicit relationships among components used in a patent, and are considered to represent key concepts of the patent or the expertise of the inventor. Based on the internal similarities between patents, the patent network provides the up-to-date status of a given technology. Furthermore, this paper suggests new indices to identify the technological importance of patents, the characteristics of patent clusters, and the technological capabilities of competitors.

Degree centrality reveals that intraregional and international collaborations are the main channels of knowledge exchange for the provinces and municipalities of China while inter-regional knowledge exchange is relatively weak. Besides, over the two decades, the knowledge exchange network has been expanding (connecting an increasing number of provinces and countries), becoming more decentralized (increasing number of hubs) and more cohesive (more linkages). A blockmodel analysis further reveals that the inter-regional network of China begins to show characteristics of a core-periphery structure. The most active knowledge exchange occurs between members of the core block composed by the most advanced provinces while the members of the peripheral block from less favored regions have few or no local and extra-local knowledge exchange.

Globalization of science, in this respect, implies that collaboration among scientists takes place along the lines of common topics and irrespective of the spatial distances between the collaborators. The networks of collaborators, termed 'epistemic communities', should thus have a space-independent structure. This paper shows that such a notion of globalized scientific collaboration is not supported by empirical data. It introduces a novel approach of analyzing distance-dependent probabilities of collaboration. The results of the analysis of six distinct scientific fields reveal that intra-country collaboration is about 10-50 times more likely to occur than international collaboration. Moreover, strong dependencies exist between collaboration activity (measured in co-authorships) and spatial distance when confined to national borders. However, the fact that distance becomes irrelevant once collaboration is taken to the international scale suggests a globalized science system that is strongly influenced by the gravity of local science clusters. The similarity of the probability functions of the six science fields analyzed suggests a universal mode of spatial governance that is independent from the mode of knowledge creation in science.

The results confirm our expectation: the very high position of women in co-operation is striking; female scientists are relatively overrepresented as first authors in articles.

This paper describes a summarization system for the biomedical domain that represents documents as graphs formed from concepts and relations in the UMLS Metathesaurus. This system has to deal with the ambiguities that occur in biomedical documents. We describe a variety of strategies that make use of MetaMap and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) to accurately map biomedical documents onto UMLS Metathesaurus concepts. Evaluation is carried out using a collection of 150 biomedical scientific articles from the BioMed Central corpus. We find that using WSD improves the quality of the summaries generated.

Methodologically, we describe a matching and disambiguation procedure for the identification of author-inventors (researchers who publish and patent) located in the same country. Our methodology aims to maximize precision and recall rates by taking into account national name writing customs and country-specific dictionaries for person and institution names (academic and non-academic) in the name matching stage and by including a recursive validation step in the person disambiguation stage. An application of this methodology to the identification of Spanish author-inventors is described in detail. Empirically, we present the first results of applying the described methodology to the matching of all SCOPUS 2003-2008 publications of Spanish authors to all 1978-2009 EPO applications with Spanish inventors. Using this data, we identify 4,194 Spanish author-inventors. A first look at their patenting and publication patterns reveals that they make quite a significant contribution to the country's overall scientific and technological production in the time period considered: 27 % of all EPO patent applications invented in Spain and 15 % of all SCOPUS publications authored in Spain, excluding non-technological disciplines. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a large scale identification of author-inventors from Spain has been done, with no limitation in terms of fields, regions or types of institutions. We also make available online for scientific use an anonymized subset of the database (patent applications invented by authors affiliated to Spanish public universities).",0.06,12,2014,8,256,2.183,11,32,2,4,27,2

In order to retrieve information from this data, each document is commonly represented as a set of keywords, and then all documents are analysed based on the set of discriminative words. In information retrieval the recognition of words in articles is an essential step; however, unlike English, Chinese words are not distinguished by spaces. Therefore, many approaches have been devised to parse Chinese words. The dictionary-based approach is commonly used in most current systems for text segmentation. However, general purpose dictionaries are not always able to provide proper references to accurately parse the domain-specific words, especially with unknown words. This paper aims to propose a new method for classifying longer keywords from Chinese documents by incorporating previously unknown keywords into a keyword list without the effort of building domain-specific dictionaries. Our method first utilizes the parsed words from existing parsers and filters the keywords utilizing term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) values; further, based on the parsed words and keywords, a T tree is used to store the candidates for composing unknown words. The candidates are evaluated by an unknown word (UW) coefficient threshold, i.e. newly composed words are deemed as newly discovered unknown words if their UW coefficient is higher than a pre-defined threshold. Finally, the parsed words and newly composed words are re-filtered to form long keywords.

The algorithm uses document-contexts by splitting the retrieval list into sub-lists according to the query term patterns that exist in the top ranked documents. Query term patterns include a single query term, a pair of query terms that occur in a phrase and query terms that occur in proximity. The algorithm is an iterative algorithm which takes one document for feedback in each of the iterations.

We have tested the model in an interactive searching study with family doctors with the purpose to explore doctors' querying behaviour, how they applied the means for specifying a search, and how these features contributed to the search outcome. In general, the doctors were capable of exploiting system features and search tactics during the searching. Most searchers produced well-structured queries that contained appropriate search facets.

Evaluation results of our algorithm achieve useful precision/recall values. We apply the classification algorithm to two large Search Query Logs, recorded by AOL and Microsoft Research in 2006, and obtain a set of 110,000 queries containing explicit goals. To study the nature of human goals in Search Query Logs, we conduct qualitative, quantitative and comparative analyses. Our findings suggest that Search Query Logs (i) represent a viable source for extracting human goals, (ii) contain a great variety of human goals and (iii) contain human goals that can be employed to complement existing commonsense knowledge bases. Finally, we illustrate the potential of goal knowledge for addressing following application scenario: to refine and extend commonsense knowledge with human goals from Search Query Logs. This work is relevant for (i) knowledge engineers interested in acquiring human goals from textual corpora and constructing knowledge bases of human goals (ii) researchers interested in studying characteristics of human goals in Search Query Logs.

This study analysed the bibliometric and semantic nature of negative results publications. The Journal of Negative Results in Biomedicine (JNRBM) was used as a role model. Its complete articles from 2002-2009 were extracted from SCOPUS and supplemented by related records. Complementary negative results records were retrieved from Web of Science in ""Biochemistry"" and ""Telecommunications"". Applied bibliometrics comprised of co-author and co-affiliation analysis and a citation impact profile. Bibliometrics showed that authorship is widely spread. A specific community for the publication of negative results in devoted literature is non-existent. Neither co-author nor co-affiliation analysis indicated strong interconnectivities. JNRBM articles are cited by a broad spectrum of journals rather than by specific titles. Devoted negative results journals like JNRBM have a rather low impact measured by the number of received citations. On the other hand, only one-third of the publications remain uncited, corroborating their importance for the scientific community. The semantic analysis relies on negative expressions manually identified in JNRBM article titles and abstracts and extracted to syntactic patterns. By using a Natural Language Processing tool these patterns are then employed to detect their occurrences in the multidisciplinary bibliographical database PASCAL. The translation of manually identified negation patterns to syntactic patterns and their application to multidisciplinary bibliographic databases (PASCAL, Web of Science) proved to be a successful method to retrieve even hidden negative results. There is proof that negative results are not only restricted to the biomedical domain. Interestingly a high percentage of the so far identified negative results papers were funded and therefore needed to be published.

This method includes four steps: feature space construction, topic-wise words identification and weighting, semantic mapping, and similarity calculation. We firstly construct the feature space based on all accumulated questions and calculate the feature vector of each predefined category which contains certain accumulated questions. When a new question is posted, the semantic pattern of the question is used to identify and weigh the important words of the question. After that, the question is semantically mapped into the constructed feature space to enrich its representation. Finally, the similarity between the question and each category is calculated based on their feature vectors. The category with the highest similarity is assigned to the question.

To tackle the problem, in this paper we propose a novel approach to learning to rank, based on a probabilistic graphical model. Considering that the observed label might be noisy, we introduce a new variable to indicate the true label of each instance. We then use a graphical model to capture the joint distribution of the true labels and observed labels given features of documents. The graphical model distinguishes the true labels from observed labels, and is specially designed for ranking in information retrieval. Therefore, it helps to learn a more accurate model from noisy training data.

Specifically, we propose a mixture model based feedback method that can utilize the pseudo feedback entities to estimate an enriched model for the relation between the input and related entities. Experimental results over two standard TREC collections show that the derived relation generation model combined with a relation feedback method performs better than other models.

Based on 919 cited publications in English which appeared between 1973 and 2011, the analysis covers the following issues: general statistical description, influential journal outlets and top cited articles, geographic distribution of resilience publications and covered case studies, national importance of resilience researchers and leading research organisations by country. The findings show that resilience thinking continues to dominate environmental sciences and has experienced a dramatic increase since its introduction in 1973. More recently, new interest has emerged for broadening the scope and applying the concept to socio-economic systems and sustainability science. The paper also shows that resilience research overall is dominated by USA, Australia, UK and Sweden, and makes the case for the need to expand this work further in the urgent need for practically oriented solutions that would help arrest further ecological deterioration.",0.04,48,2013,4,189,2.274,8,17,2,12,171,5

Nevertheless, since their introduction nearly a century ago significance tests have been controversial. Many researchers are not aware of the numerous criticisms raised against NHST. As practiced, NHST has been characterized as a 'null ritual' that is overused and too often misapplied and misinterpreted. NHST is in fact a patchwork of two fundamentally different classical statistical testing models, often blended with some wishful quasi-Bayesian interpretations. This is undoubtedly a major reason why NHST is very often misunderstood. But NHST also has intrinsic logical problems and the epistemic range of the information provided by such tests is much more limited than most researchers recognize. In this article we introduce to the scientometric community the theoretical origins of NHST, which is mostly absent from standard statistical textbooks, and we discuss some of the most prevalent problems relating to the practice of NHST and trace these problems back to the mix-up of the two different theoretical origins. Finally, we illustrate some of the misunderstandings with examples from the scientometric literature and bring forward some modest recommendations for a more sound practice in quantitative data analysis.",0.04,47,2015,5,214,2.084,18,22,1,43,841,16

In the past, several approaches to assess similarity by evaluating the knowledge modeled in an (or multiple) ontology (or ontologies) have been proposed. However, there are some limitations such as the facts of relying on predefined ontologies and fitting non-dynamic domains in the existing measures. Wilcipedia provides a very large domain-independent encyclopedic repository and semantic network for computing semantic similarity of concepts with more coverage than usual ontologies. In this paper, we propose some novel feature based similarity assessment methods that are fully dependent on Wikipedia and can avoid most of the limitations and drawbacks introduced above. To implement similarity assessment based on feature by making use of Wikipedia, firstly a formal representation of Wikipedia concepts is presented. We then give a framework for feature based similarity based on the formal representation of Wikipedia concepts. Lastly, we investigate several feature based approaches to semantic similarity measures resulting from instantiations of the framework. The evaluation, based on several widely used benchmarks and a benchmark developed in ourselves, sustains the intuitions with respect to human judgements. Overall, several methods proposed in this paper have good human correlation and constitute some effective ways of determining similarity between Wikipedia concepts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For this task, the nearest-neighbor-based scheme works in two phases: first, it finds the most similar neighbors of a new image from the set of labeled images; then, it propagates the keywords associated with the neighbors to the new image. In this article, we propose a novel approach for image annotation, which simultaneously improves both phases of the nearest-neighbor-based scheme. In the phase of neighbor search, different from existing work discovering the nearest neighbors with the predicted distance, we introduce a ranking-oriented neighbor search mechanism (RNSM), where the ordering of labeled images is optimized directly without going through the intermediate step of distance prediction. In the phase of keyword propagation, different from existing work using simple heuristic rules to select the propagated keywords, we present a learning-based keyword propagation strategy (LKPS), where a scoring function is learned to evaluate the relevance of keywords based on their multiple relations with the nearest neighbors.

However, most state-of-the-art cross-domain classification methods treat documents as plain text and ignore the hyperlink (or citation) relationship existing among the documents. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain document classification approach called Link-Bridged Topic model (LBT). LBT consists of two key steps. Firstly, LBT utilizes an auxiliary link network to discover the direct or indirect co-citation relationship among documents by embedding the background knowledge into a graph kernel. The mined co-citation relationship is leveraged to bridge the gap across different domains. Secondly, LBT simultaneously combines the content information and link structures into a unified latent topic model. The model is based on an assumption that the documents of source and target domains share some common topics from the point of view of both content information and link structure. By mapping both domains data into the latent topic spaces, LBT encodes the knowledge about domain commonality and difference as the shared topics with associated differential probabilities. The learned latent topics must be consistent with the source and target data, as well as content and link statistics. Then the shared topics act as the bridge to facilitate knowledge transfer from the source to the target domains. Experiments on different types of datasets show that our algorithm significantly improves the generalization performance of cross-domain document classification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

From Roosevelt (1934), each president tends to own a distinctive style whereas previous presidents tend usually to share some stylistic aspects with others. Applying an automatic classification based on the frequencies of all content-bearing word-types we show that chronology tends to play a central role in forming clusters, a factor that is more important than political affiliation. Using the 300 most frequent word-types, we generate another clustering representation based on the style of each president. This second view shares similarities with the first one, but usually with more numerous and smaller clusters. Finally, an authorship attribution approach for each speech can reach a success rate of around 95.7% under some constraints.

We revisit the relationship between urban population size and patenting using data for a global set of metropolitan areas in the OECD and show, for the first time, that the superlinear scaling between patenting and population size observed for US metropolitan areas holds for urban areas across a variety of urban and economic systems.

Ontologies play an important role in supporting automated processes to access information and are at the core of new strategies for the development of knowledge-based systems. Yet, developing an ontology is a time-consuming task which often needs an accurate domain expertise to tackle structural and logical difficulties in the definition of concepts as well as conceivable relationships. This work presents an ontology-based retrieval approach, that supports data organization and visualization and provides a friendly navigation model. It exploits the fuzzy extension of the Formal Concept Analysis theory to elicit conceptualizations from datasets and generate a hierarchy-based representation of extracted knowledge.

It utilizes availability of past retrieval results consisting of the queries that contain a particular term, retrieved documents, and their relevance judgments. A term's evidential weight, as we propose in this paper, depends on the degree to which the mean frequency values for the relevant and non-relevant document distributions in the past are different. More precisely, it takes into account the rankings and similarity values of the relevant and non-relevant documents. Our experimental result using standard test collections shows that the proposed term weighting scheme improves conventional TF*IDF and language model based schemes. It indicates that evidential term weights bring in a new aspect of term importance and complement the collection statistics based on TF*IDF.

The demonstration process was carried on the field of industrial biotechnology (IB) from 2000 to 2010. The results show that the number of assignees in the field of IB grew steadily, while the number of patents decreased slowly year by year after it reached peak in 2002 and 2003. Densification and growth analysis, average degree, density and components analysis showed that the collaboration networks tended to density. Especially the diameter analysis indicated that the IB field had come into a mature mode after finishing the topological transition occurred in about 2002 or 2003. The nodes had degree k followed a power law distribution, which implied a preferential linking feature of the network evolving and thus provided a foundation for link prediction from the aspect of network evolving. Basing on this, two network-related factors had been brought into the LCI model, which were degree and network distance. Their values were positive and negative for link prediction respectively. In addition, types of assignees, geographical distances and topics similarities had also been added into the LCI model. Different types of assignees had also different probabilities to be linked, such as corporations had been collaborated more frequently, while universities ranked lowest based on collaborations. Assignees from the same countries seemed to be likely to collaborate to each other. It have to been noted that the LCI model is flexible that can be adjusted of the factors or their weights according to different subjects, time or data. For instance, the topics similarities between assignees would be removed from the LCI model for link prediction in the field of IB because of the poor inference from topics similarities to collaborations. Actually, many promising pairs of assignees that seemed to have the potential to collaborate to each other according to one or more of these factors have never collaborated. One possible reason might be that collaboration is not popular behaviours among assignees during the process of patent application or maintain. Another reason could be the competitions between assignees. Many a time the promising pairs are competing pairs. Therefore, it was hard to carry out regression analysis basing on those four factors to get usable coefficients set of the four factors.

In large measure, this stems from difficulties relating how private sector companies and technologies benefit from the major outputs of science research, such as papers, patents and conference proceedings. Here, we propose a data-mining procedure to assess the technological importance of patents, supported by a basic research funding, beyond academic and public sector entities. We applied this approach to patents partially funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR). Our procedure begins by identifying a large sample of AFOSR-funded patents and classifying their most recent patent assignees as listed on the US patent assignment database, where one can find records of patent rights being transferred between individuals or institutions. Next, the patents citing this sample of AFOSR-funded patents is mined and, again, we classify their associated assignees to estimate the downstream technological importance of basic research investments. Interestingly, while patents directly funded by AFOSR are modestly assigned to organizations in the private sector (similar to 20 %), patents citing these AFOSR-funded patents are overwhelmingly assigned to the private sector (similar to 86%). Following data collection, we consider whether patterns emerging from assignee data of both AFOSR-funded patents and the patents citing AFOSR-funded patents provide insights into real-world examples of the impact of government sponsored invention. As a case study, we investigated the most frequent assignee for patents citing our sample of AFOSR-funded patents: Digimarc Corporation. Examining the relationship between AFOSR-funded invention and Digimarc revealed several highly cited patents were granted based on government-funded academic research in mathematics and signal processing. These patents became the kernel of a tech start-up by the inventors, Cognicity, which was later acquired by Digimarc. These patents continue to contribute to the patent portfolio of this large technology service provider.

However, author name ambiguity may lead to irrelevant retrieval results. To improve the PubMed user experience with author name queries, we designed an author name disambiguation system consisting of similarity estimation and agglomerative clustering. A machine-learning method was employed to score the features for disambiguating a pair of papers with ambiguous names. These features enable the computation of pairwise similarity scores to estimate the probability of a pair of papers belonging to the same author, which drives an agglomerative clustering algorithm regulated by 2 factors: name compatibility and probability level. With transitivity violation correction, high precision author clustering is achieved by focusing on minimizing false-positive pairing.

The achievement of innovation activities in China primarily falls on the enterprise, especially FEs and POEs. The innovation strengths of the three development phases have shifted from government to university and research institute and then industry.

In this article, for a number of real-world as well as Watts-Strogatz model networks, we investigated the profile of the network small-worldness as random failures, i.e. errors, or systematic failures, i.e. attacks, occurred in the nodes. In errors nodes are randomly removed along with all their tipping edges, while in attacks the nodes with highest degrees are removed from the network. Interestingly, in many cases, the small-worldness of violated networks increased as more nodes underwent an attack. This indicates an important role of the hub nodes in controlling the small-worldness of Watts-Strogatz networks. The profile of changes in the small-worldness as a result of errors/attacks was independent of network size, while it was influenced by average degree and rewiring probability of Watts-Strogatz model. We also found that the pattern of the changes of the small-worldness in real-world networks is completely different than that of the Watts-Strogatz networks. Therefore, although Watts-Strogatz model is often used for constructing networks with small-world property, the resulting networks have different properties compared to real-world ones in terms of robustness in the small-worldness index against errors/attacks.

Barycenters can be calculated starting from a similarity matrix of subject categories (N dimensions) or from a visualization thereof (2 dimensions). We compare the results of the N-dimensional method with those of two 2-dimensional ones (Kamada-Kawai maps and VOS maps) and find that they yield very similar results.

Moreover, past journal ratings conducted by the Handelsblatt and the GEA directly affect journals' reputation among German economists and indirectly also their perceived relevance, but the effect on reputation is more than twice as large as the effect on perceived relevance. In general, citations have a non-linear impact on perceived journal reputation and relevance. While the number of landmark articles published in a journal (as measured by the so-called H-index) increases the journal's reputation, an increase in the H-index even tends to decrease a journal's perceived relevance, as long as this is not simultaneously reflected in a higher Handelsblatt and/or GEA rating.

Using Bag-Of-Words for text representation dramatically increases the computational time of AdaBoost.MH learning, especially for large-scale datasets. In this paper we demonstrate how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of AdaBoost.MH using latent topics, rather than words. A well-known probabilistic topic modelling method, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, is used to estimate the latent topics in the corpus as features for AdaBoost.MH. To evaluate LDA-AdaBoost.MH, the following four datasets have been used: Reuters-21578-ModApte, WebKB, 20-Newsgroups and a collection of Arabic news. The experimental results confirmed that representing the texts as a small number of latent topics, rather than a large number of words, significantly decreased the computational time of AdaBoost.MH learning and improved its performance for text categorization.",0.01,15,2015,6,202,0.878,11,14,3,8,110,6

For reasons such as acceptable accuracy, rapid training and high interpretability, associative classifiers have recently been used in many categorization tasks. Although features could be very useful in text classification, both training time and the number of produced rules will increase significantly owing to the high dimensionality of text documents. In this paper an association classification algorithm for text classification is proposed that includes a feature selection phase to select important features and a clustering phase based on class labels to tackle this shortcoming. The experimental results from applying the proposed algorithm in comparison with the results of selected well-known classification algorithms show that our approach outperforms others both in efficiency and in performance.",0.01,14,2015,3,132,0.878,13,13,3,2,25,2

However, it remains unknown what makes searchers feel the difficulty. A study consisting of 48 undergraduate students was conducted to explore this question. Each participant was given 4 search tasks that were carefully designed following a task classification scheme. Questionnaires were used to elicit participants' ratings on task difficulty and why they gave those ratings. Based on the collected difficulty reasons, a coding scheme was developed, which covered various aspects of task, user, and user-task interaction. Difficulty reasons were then categorized following this scheme. Results showed that searchers reported some common reasons leading to task difficulty in different tasks, but most of the difficulty reasons varied across tasks. In addition, task difficulty had some common reasons between searchers with low and high levels of topic knowledge, although there were also differences in top task difficulty reasons between high and low knowledge users. These findings further our understanding of search task difficulty, the relationship between task difficulty and task type, and that between task difficulty and knowledge level. The findings can also be helpful with designing tasks for information search experiments, and have implications on search system design both in general and for personalization based on task type and searchers' knowledge.

However, when presented with many evidence documents, users do not necessarily read and trust them uniformly. Psychologists and other researchers have shown that users tend to follow and agree with articles and sources that hold viewpoints similar to their own, a phenomenon known as confirmation bias. This suggests that when learning about a controversial topic, human biases and viewpoints about the topic may affect what is considered ""trustworthy"" or credible. It is an interesting challenge to build systems that can help users overcome this bias and help them decide the truthfulness of claims. In this article, we study various factors that enable humans to acquire additional information about controversial claims in an unbiased fashion. Specifically, we designed a user study to understand how presenting evidence with contrasting viewpoints and source expertise ratings affect how users learn from the evidence documents. We find that users do not seek contrasting viewpoints by themselves, but explicitly presenting contrasting evidence helps them get a well-rounded understanding of the topic. Furthermore, explicit knowledge of the credibility of the sources and the context in which the source provides the evidence document not only affects what users read but also whether they perceive the document to be credible.",0.01,9,2015,3,238,1.864,7,18,4,39,358,12

This study explored the interactions and the usability of various search interfaces, and the enjoyment or uncertainty experienced by children when using them. Structural Equation Modeling was used to determine whether children feel uncertainty or a sense of control when using virtual game-like interfaces to search for information associated with entertainment or as a means to satisfy an assigned learning task. We then analyzed the weight relationships among three latent variables (information needs, interface media, and affective state) using statistical (path) analysis. Our results indicate that children prefer using a retrieval interface with situated affordance to satisfy entertainment-related information needs, as opposed to searching for information to solve specific problems. Furthermore, their perceptions of text and graphic icons determined the degree to which they experienced a sense of uncertainty or control. When searching for entertainment-related information, they were better able to deal with uncertainty and sought greater control in their search interface, compared to when they were searching for information related to assigned tasks. According to their information needs, children may regard a game-like interface as a toy or a tool for learning. The results of this study can serve as reference for the future development of information search interfaces aimed at arousing the interest of children.

Compared with other clustering algorithms, it can provide representatives for each cluster and does not need to pre-specify the number of clusters. Because the input of the AP algorithm is the similarity matrix among data points, it can be applied to various forms of data sets with different similarity metrics. In this paper, we extract the similarity matrices from the journal data sets in both cross citation view and text view and use the AP algorithm to cluster the journals. Through empirical analysis, we conclude that these two clustering results by the two single views are highly complementary. Therefore, we further combine text information with cross citation information by using the simple average scheme and apply the AP algorithm to conduct multi-view clustering.

We invoke several assumptions such as independence among attributes and that administrators can affect the values of some of the attributes and know the cost of doing so.

Our main findings are as follows: first, the number of webpages of HEI websites is strongly associated with their size, and to a lesser extent, with the volume of their educational activities, research orientation, and reputation; differences between European countries are rather limited, supporting the insight that the academic Web has reached a mature stage. Second, the distribution of connectivity (as measured by the total degree of HEI's) follows a lognormal distribution typical of social networks between organizations, while counts of weblinks can be predicted with good precision from organizational characteristics. HEIs with larger websites tend to send and receive more links, but the effect is rather limited and does not fundamentally modify the resulting network structure. We conclude that aggregated counts of weblinks between pairs of HEIs are not significantly affected by the web policies of HEIs and thus can be considered as reasonably robust measures.

The state-of-the-art solution known as the narrow-down approach utilizes a search engine to reduce an entire category hierarchy to most relevant categories and selects the best one among them using a classifier. In a recent language modelling approach, top-level category information (or global information) was used in judging the appropriateness of a local category, which led to performance improvements. However, we observe that using global information has a limited influence on the final category selection under some conditions. First, global information may be inaccurate even though it is generated by a top-level category classifier using an entire hierarchy. Second, it has little influence when two competing categories share the same top-level category or when the local category information has too strong an influence on the final category selection. To resolve the limitations, in this paper, we propose two external methods: (1) a meta-classifier with novel dependency features among top-level categories based on an ensemble learning framework; and (2) a query modification model based on a statistical feedback method to improve the query document representation instead of just juggling with information in the hierarchy.

Extrinsic bibliometric and citation indicators were collected from the Internet for each document; intrinsic indicators reflecting content-based quality were developed and relevant data gathered by peer review. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and structural modeling were used to explore statistical relationships among latent factors or concepts and their indicators. Three intrinsic and two extrinsic latent factors were found to be relevant. Moreover, the more a document was related to a reviewer's own area of research, the higher the score the reviewer gave concerning (1) significance, originality, and consistency, and (2) methodological adequacy. The conclusions are that a prototype EERQI framework has been constructed: intrinsic quality indicators add specific information to extrinsic quality or impact indicators, and vice versa. Also, a problem of ""objective"" impact scores is that they are based on ""subjective"" or biased peer-review scores. Peer-review, which is foundational to having a work cited, seems biased and this bias should be controlled or improved by more refined estimates of quality and impact of research. Some suggestions are given and limitations of the pilot are discussed. As the EERQI development approach, instruments, and tools are new, they should be developed further.",0,0,2015,5,297,2.084,14,19,1,38,471,14

Online group recommenders identify items of interest, such as restaurants, movies, and books, that satisfy the collective needs of a group (rather than the interests of individual group members). With a number of new movies being released every week, online recommenders play a significant role in suggesting movies for family members or groups of friends/people to watch, either at home or at movie theaters. Making group recommendations relevant to the joint interests of a group, however, is not a trivial task due to the diversity in preferences among group members. To address this issue, we introduce GroupReM which makes movie recommendations appealing (to a certain degree) to members of a group by (i) employing a merging strategy to explore individual group members' interests in movies and create a profile that reflects the preferences of the group on movies, (ii) using word-correlation factors to find movies similar in content, and (iii) considering the popularity of movies at a movie website. Unlike existing group recommenders based on collaborative filtering (CF) which consider ratings of movies to perform the recommendation task, GroupReM primarily employs (personal) tags for capturing the contents of movies considered for recommendation and group members' interests. The design of GroupReM, which is simple and domain-independent, can easily be extended to make group recommendations on items other than movies. Empirical studies conducted using more than 3000 groups of different users in the MovieLens dataset, which are various in terms of numbers and preferences in movies, show that GroupReM is highly effective and efficient in recommending movies appealing to a group. Experimental results also verify that GroupReM outperforms popular CF-based recommenders in making group recommendations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Although joint models, such as joint sentiment/topic and maximum entropy (MaxEnt)/latent Dirichlet allocation, are proposed to tackle this problem of sentiment analysis, they focus on the joint learning of both aspects and sentiments. Thus, they are not appropriate to solve the cascade errors for sentiment analysis at the sentence or subsentence level.

Perceptions of injustice concerning the process (procedural injustice), by comparison, have a direct impact on defections and exert a stronger influence on dissatisfaction than distributive injustice. Justice emerges as a hygiene factor adding to the level of dissatisfaction among dissatisfied contributors but not among satisfied contributors.

This article addresses this problem by automating the construction of a structured query from a keywords query that is more familiar to the web search user. As a result, a query transformation framework is proposed. Different from the existing framework, which is a one-time solution, our proposed framework has greater flexibility in accommodating new structured query languages and different collection types. A novel intermediate query representation is designed to handle transformation to multiple types of query languages, whereas a context-based probabilistic model is designed to capture the structural features of both homogeneous and heterogeneous collections. Experimental results show that the structured queries generated from our framework give promising results compared with their source queries.

However, structural linguistics relies on both syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations to deduce the meaning of a word. Given the success of dependency-based approaches to query expansion and the reliance on word meanings in the query formulation process, we argue that modeling both syntagmatic and paradigmatic information in the query expansion process improves retrieval effectiveness. This article develops and evaluates a new query expansion technique that is based on a formal, corpus-based model of word meaning that models syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations. We demonstrate that when sufficient statistical information exists, as in the case of longer queries, including paradigmatic information alone provides significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness across a wide variety of data sets.

In assortative networks, i.e., in networks in which people tend to connect to other similar individuals, on the other hand, it seems that the ability of leaders to influence other people is not directly related to their betweeenness centrality degree.

As far as indexing is concerned, instead of concatenating low-level visual features in high-dimensional spaces which results in curse of dimensionality and redundancy issues, we adopt a perceptual symbolic representation based on color and texture concepts. For matching, we propose to instantiate a retrieval model based on logical inference through the coupling of an N-gram sliding window process and theoretically-sound lattice-based structures. The techniques we cover are robust and insensitive to general video editing and/or degradation, making it ideal for re-broadcasted video search.

These hypotheses, along with others that emerged from subsequent interviews, are then tested using various statistical models.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for predicting affective aspects, one of the most interesting subjective aspects, of concepts in images by learning the semantic attributes of the concept and mining the association between the attributes and affective aspects. The main idea of the proposed approach comes from the assumption that semantic attributes of a concept will influence the user's affect towards the concept (e.g. an animal with the semantic attributes small', furry', white' can be associated with the affective term cute'). Based on this assumption, we build a multi-layer affect learning framework that consists of (1) an attribute learning layer that predicts semantic attributes of a concept and (2) an affect learning layer that exploits the outputs from the attribute learning layer for predicting the affective aspects of the concept. Through the experimental results on the Animals with Attributes dataset, we show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional approaches by up to 25% in terms of precision and successfully predicts the affect of concepts in images according to different user preferences.",0,2,2014,5,231,1.158,9,20,2,15,135,7

Recently, with the growing amount of information and the emergence of new technologies that deal with many sources of information, more precise and efficient parsing techniques are required. The most relevant theory to multi-document relationship, Cross-document Structure Theory (CST), has been used for parsing purposes before, though the results had not been satisfactory. CST has received many critics because of its subjectivity, which may lead to low annotation agreement and, consequently, to poor parsing performance. In this work, we propose a refinement of the original CST, which consists in (i) formalizing the relationship definitions, (ii) pruning and combining some relations based on their meaning, and (iii) organizing the relations in a hierarchical structure. The hypothesis for this refinement is that it will lead to better agreement in the annotation and consequently to better parsing results. For this aim, it was built an annotated corpus according to this refinement and it was observed an improvement in the annotation agreement. Based on this corpus, a parser was developed using machine learning techniques and hand-crafted rules. Specifically, hierarchical techniques were used to capture the hierarchical organization of the relations according to the proposed refinement of CST. These two approaches were used to identify the relations among texts spans and to generate multi-document annotation structure. Results outperformed other CST parsers, showing the adequacy of the proposed refinement in the theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0,2,2014,4,280,1.265,8,18,3,8,85,5

This paper proposes an automatic word spacing system, the first step module of natural language processing (NLP) for many languages with their own word spacing rules, that is designed for mobile devices with limited hardware resources. The proposed system uses two stages. In the first stage, it preliminarily corrects word spacing errors by using a modified hidden Markov model based on character unigrams. In the second stage, the proposed system re-corrects the miscorrected word spaces by using lexical rules based on character bigrams or longer combinations. By using this hybrid method, the proposed system improves the robustness against unknown word patterns, reduces memory usage, and increases accuracy. To evaluate the proposed system in a realistic mobile environment, we constructed a mobile-style colloquial corpus using a simple simulation method.

A new approach to information load is introduced which takes all the characteristics of information use (tacit, mechanical, paper and digitized) and possibilities of users (machine, operator and process) into consideration. Information use nodes are conceptualized building blocks for information use architecture which impact information load and usability. The results suggest that information use load is sensitive to information encoding/decoding. A combination of the federated and integrated information use architectures tends to result in a low information use load and can become a strategic tool for waste reduction.

Previous work focuses on single way differential compression called forwards and backwards delta files. Here we suggest to efficiently combine them into a single file so that the combined file is smaller than the combination of the two individual ones. Given the bidirectional delta file of two files S and T and the original file S, one can decode it in order to produce T. The same bidirectional delta file is used together with the file Tin order to reconstruct S. This paper presents two main strategies for producing an efficient bidirectional delta file in terms of the memory storage it requires; a quadratic time, optimal, dynamic programming algorithm, and a linear time, greedy algorithm. Although the dynamic programming algorithm often produces better results than the greedy algorithm, it is impractical for large files, and it is only used for theoretical comparisons. Experiments between the implemented algorithms and the traditional way of using both forwards and backwards delta files are presented, comparing their processing time and their compression performance. These experiments show memory storage savings of about 25% using this bidirectional delta approach as compared to the compressed delta file constructed using the traditional way, while preserving approximately the same processing time for decoding.

Given two word pairs (A,B) and (C,D), we propose a method to measure the relational similarity between the semantic relations that exist between the two words in each word pair. Typically, a high degree of relational similarity can be observed between proportional analogies (i.e. analogies that exist among the four words, A is to B such as C is to D). We describe eight different types of relational symmetries that are frequently observed in proportional analogies and use those symmetries to robustly and accurately estimate the relational similarity between two given word pairs. We use automatically extracted lexical-syntactic patterns to represent the semantic relations that exist between two words and then match those patterns in Web search engine snippets to find candidate words that form proportional analogies with the original word pair. We define eight types of relational symmetries for proportional analogies and use those as features in a supervised learning approach. We evaluate the proposed method using the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) word analogy benchmark dataset. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately measure relational similarity between word pairs by exploiting the symmetries that exist in proportional analogies. The proposed method achieves an SAT score of 49.2% on the benchmark dataset, which is comparable to the best results reported on this dataset. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Two M.A. experts listed all variant forms of a single university under that name. The form publicized in a university's website was considered as its entry name.

However, after this trend has reached its peak in 2002, that driving force has visibly weakened, and since the mid 2000's, the number of research publication in the field of terrorism studies has steadily decreased. Nonetheless, the number of terrorist events per year, along with the property damage and fatality rate, has continuously increased over the observed lapse of time.

While it is obvious from the definition of RSI that it can never be 1, it is less obvious, and essentially unknown, that its upper limit can be quite far from 1, depending on the scientific field. This is a consequence of the fact that AI has different upper limits for different scientific fields. This means that comparisons of RSIs, or AIs, across fields can be misleading.

Our research aims to increase the capability of communities in capturing, sharing and maintaining knowledge from any domain.

Most ontologies available these days were created by domain experts to fulfill certain domain requirements. However, in cases when domain experts are not obtainable or standard agreement within the domain is not available, such as in natural or herbal therapy domain, we propose that an ontology can also be extracted from existing knowledge-bases residing within the community. In order to achieve our aim, we design a data-driven dynamic ontology model. Our model consists of base knowledge creation and knowledge propagation phases. In the base knowledge creation phase, we define a general concept of capturing community knowledge from data into an ontology representation, rather than just transforming a specific data format into an ontology as found in existing studies. In our knowledge propagation phase, the dynamic community knowledge sources become the trigger of propagation. This is different from some approaches in existing studies, where the triggering event is an individual change inside the ontology and external data may not be the base source of the knowledge in the evolving ontology. We define the propagation feature with a novel delta script. The script is minimum yet complete to simplify and save knowledge sharing transportation resources.

In particular, it is not known whether clustering techniques are effective in medium- or large-scale multilingual document sets. For scalability, techniques should be based on dictionary-based translation and a single- or double-pass clustering algorithm. This article reports on experiments of applying multilingual document clustering to medium-scale sets of English, French, German and Italian documents (Reuters news articles). The results show that the double-pass algorithm has a positive effect in the case that each document is translated. On the other hand, the cluster translation strategy in which clusters obtained by applying a clustering algorithm to each language document set are translated has almost no effect.

This paper presents a new scheme for solving context ambiguities using a field association scheme. Generally, the scope of case frames is restricted to one sentence; however, the scope of the field association scheme can be applied to a set of sentences. In this paper, a formal disambiguation algorithm is proposed to control the scope for a set of variable number of sentences with ambiguities as well as solve ambiguities by calculating the weight of fields. In the experiments, 52 English and 20 Chinese words are disambiguated by using 104,532 Chinese and 38,372 English field association terms. The accuracy of the proposed field association scheme for context ambiguities is 65% higher than the case frame method.

We extend the ideas of online clustering and batch-mode centroid-based classification to online learning with negative feedback. The 3LM is a competitive learning algorithm, which avoids over-smoothing, characteristic of the centroid-based classifiers, by using a different class representative, which we call clusterhead. The clusterheads competing for vector-space dominance are drawn toward misclassified documents, eventually bringing the model to a ""balanced state"" for a fixed distribution of documents. Subsequently, the clusterheads oscillate between the misclassified documents, heuristically minimizing the rate of misclassifications, an NP-complete problem. Further, the 3LM algorithm prevents over-fitting by ""leashing"" the clusterheads to their respective centroids. A clusterhead provably converges if its class can be separated by a hyper-plane from all other classes. Lifelong learning with fixed learning rate allows 3LM to adapt to possibly changing distribution of the data and continually learn and unlearn document classes. We report on our experiments, which demonstrate high accuracy of document classification on Reuters21578, OHSUMED, and TREC07p-spam datasets.

Technical developments in the area of search, such as Google's Page Rank algorithm, have proved so good at serving relevant results that Internet search has become integrated into daily human activity. One can endlessly explore topics of interest simply by querying and reading through the resulting links. Yet, although search engines are well known for providing relevant results based on users' queries, users do not always receive the results they are looking for. Google's Director of Research describes clickstream evidence of frustrated users repeatedly reformulating queries and searching through page after page of results. Given the general quality of search engine results, one must consider the possibility that the frustrated user's query is not effective; that is, it does not describe the essence of the user's interest. Indeed, extensive research into human search behavior has found that humans are not very effective at formulating good search queries that describe what they are interested in. Ideally, the user should simply point to a portion of text that sparked the user's interest, and a system should automatically formulate a search query that captures the essence of the text. In this paper, we describe an implemented system that provides this capability. We first describe how our work differs from existing work in automatic query formulation, and propose a new method for improved quantification of the relevance of candidate search terms drawn from input text using phrase-level analysis.

Wittfogel's (1957) Eastern autocracy states that 2 environmental dimensions, rainfall and sea border, influence the origin of democracy. This study examined Wittfogel's Eastern autocracy theory through statistical analysis of average annual precipitation, land boundaries, latitudes, and annual temperature of 196 countries and territories with their freedom levels defined by Freedom House, to find out the correlations between these geospatial factors and democracy. In addition, this study extended its investigation to web interface design by examining democracy represented on college/university websites in correlations with these geospatial factors. A total of 130 college/university websites selected from 65 countries were coded and examined systematically in linear and multiple regression analyses. This study concluded that democracy correlates positively with annual precipitation and latitude, but negatively with land boundaries and annual temperature. Furthermore, this study indicated that these 4 geospatial variables associate with democracy represented on web interface design, although the associations are not statistically significant. This study also suggested that it is more accurate to predict democracy if the 4 geospatial factors are considered together as dependent variables.

Topic modeling is a branch of machine learning and probabilistic graphical modeling that helps in arranging the web pages according to their topical structure. The topic distribution over a set of documents (web pages) and the affinity of a document toward a specific topic can be revealed using topic modeling. Topic modeling algorithms are typically computationally expensive due to their iterative nature. Recent research efforts have attempted to parallelize specific topic models and are successful in their attempts. These parallel algorithms however have tightly-coupled parallel processes which require frequent synchronization and are also tightly coupled with the underlying topic model which is used for inferring the topic hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm to infer topic hierarchies from a large scale document corpus. A key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it exploits coarse grained parallelism and the components running in parallel need not synchronize after every iteration, thus the algorithm lends itself to be implemented on a geographically dispersed set of processing elements interconnected through a network. The parallel algorithm realizes a speed up of 53.5 on a 32-node cluster of dual-core workstations and at the same time achieving approximately the same likelihood or predictive accuracy as that of the sequential algorithm, with respect to the performance of Information Retrieval tasks.

From the results of cross-tabulation analysis, it has become clear that a growing proportion of transfers involving the appointment of professors involve movements between very similar universities (transferral blocking phenomenon), and that there is a growing tendency for professorial appointments to involve a migration from universities with a lower share of published research papers to universities with a higher share. Also, by constructing a log-linear model and performing a residual analysis, we have found that although these trends are clearly apparent, they do not yet have a great deal of influence.",0,1,2011,5,179,1.966,26,26,1,2,2,1

Such complex relations are successfully extracted using a syntactic tree-based pattern matching method. While induced subtree patterns are typically used to model the relations of multiple entities, we argue that hard pattern matching between a pattern database and instance trees cannot allow us to examine similar tree structures. Thus, we explore a tree alignment-based soft pattern matching approach to improve the coverage of induced patterns. Our pattern learning algorithm iteratively searches the most influential dependency tree patterns as well as a control parameter for each pattern. The resulting method outperforms two baselines, a pairwise approach with the tree-kernel support vector machine and a hard pattern matching method, on two standard datasets for a complex relation extraction task.

In the computational model, we first propose constraint-based exploration by incorporating transliteration knowledge from transliteration modeling and predictive query suggestions from search engines into query formulation as constraints so as to increase the chance of desired transliteration returns in learning regional transliteration variants. Then, we study a cross-training algorithm, which explores the attainably helpful information of transliteration mappings across related regional corpora for the learning of transliteration models, to improve the overall extraction performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only effectively harvests a lexicon of regional transliteration variants but also mitigates the need of manual data labeling for transliteration modeling. We also carry out an investigation into the underlying characteristics of regional transliterations that motivate the cross-training algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We first represent query concepts as probabilistically weighted n-grams and extract them from the search log data. We then expand the original log queries with such concepts, defining the affinity between two queries as the similarity of their expanded representations. Finally, after building the graph of Theta-affine queries (for a given threshold Theta), we find the generalized k-cores of this graph, which coincide with the sets of queries satisfying Ice-affinity privacy. Experimenting with the AOL dataset, we compare k-anonymity under affinity to k-anonymity under equality and under WordNet generalization.

Researchers have identified some important stages in this pattern. The psychological stages broadly include befriending, information exchange, grooming, and approach. Similarities among the posts of a chat play an important role in differentiating as well as in identifying these stages. In this article a novel similarity measure is constructed which gives high Inter-post-similarity among the chat-posts within a particular behavioral stage and low inter-post-similarity across different behavioral stages. A psychological stage corpus-based dictionary is constructed from mining the terms associated with each stage. The dictionary works as a background knowledge-base to support the similarity measure.

For multiple-part manuscripts having reached a final decision, 67% were accepted, which was also the average acceptance rate of all manuscripts (67%).

Two-part manuscripts submitted together had an acceptance rate (67%) comparable to the average. Typical reviewer comments for Part I manuscripts submitted alone included the manuscript being too long for the available results and the author making claims in Part I that would be supported in the unseen Part II. Typical comments for Part 11 manuscripts submitted alone included the somewhat contradictory statements that material was unnecessarily duplicated in the two manuscripts and more repetition was needed between the two parts. For two-part manuscripts submitted together, reviewers often recommended condensing the two manuscripts and merging them into one. In some cases, editors rejected manuscripts even though no reviewer recommended rejection because the sum of all reviewers' comments would require substantial reorganization of the manuscripts.

Although the supply is clearly a driver of demand, there are other variables that significantly influence the demand rates.

The first one is to modelize the demand for Masters Programs in the Spanish public university system. We propose a panel methodology to estimate the behavior of the demand of Masters Programs based on the data provided by the seventeen Spanish Autonomous Communities. Disaggregated analysis are presented for domestic demand and international demand. We conclude that the offer is a powerful attractor of demand for domestic and international students, and therefore actions of supply reduction should be carefully applied and always according to strategic university policy criteria.

There is a rich literature on problems related to data exchange, e.g., the design of a schema mapping language, the consistency of schema mappings, operations on mappings, and query answering over mappings. Data exchange is extensively studied on relational model, and is also recently discussed for XML data. This article investigates the construction of target instance for XML data exchange, which has received far less attention. We first present a rich language for the definition of schema mappings, which allow one to use various forms of document navigation and specify conditions on data values. Given a schema mapping, we then provide an algorithm to construct a canonical target instance. The schema mapping alone is not adequate for expressing target semantics, and hence, the canonical instance is in general not optimal. We recognize that target constraints play a crucial role in the generation of good solutions. In light of this, we employ a general XML constraint model to define target constraints. Structural constraints and keys are used to identify a certain entity, as rules for data merging. Moreover, we develop techniques to enforce non-key constraints on the canonical target instance, by providing a chase method to reason about data. Experimental results show that our algorithms scale well, and are effective in producing target instances of good quality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a method of detecting new technological opportunities by using subject-action-object (SAO)-based semantic patent analysis and outlier detection. SAO structures are syntactically ordered sentences that can be automatically extracted by natural language processing of patent text; they explicitly show the structural relationships among technological components in a patent, and thus encode key findings of inventions and the expertise of inventors. Therefore, the proposed method allows quantification of structural dissimilarities among patents. We use outlier detection to identify unusual or distinctive patents in a given technology area; some of these outlier patents may represent new technological opportunities.

The intensity of the fatigue experience varies along a continuum ranging from a mild or transient experience to a more severe experience, which may eventually result in the user's decision to quit the environment that causes stress.

An important factor to identify the possibility of patent infringement is the technological similarity among patents, so this paper considered technological similarity as a criterion for judging the possibility of infringement. Technological similarities can be measured by transforming patent documents into abstracted forms which contain specific technological key-findings and structural relationships among technological components in the invention. Although keyword-based technological similarity has been widely adopted for patent analysis related research, it is inadequate for identifying patent infringement because a keyword vector cannot reflect specific technological key-findings and structural relationships among technological components. As a remedy, this paper exploited a subject-action-object (SAO) based semantic technological similarity. An SAO structure explicitly describes the structural relationships among technological components in the patent, and the set of SAO structures is considered to be a detailed picture of the inventor's expertise, which is the specific key-findings in the patent. Therefore, an SAO based semantic technological similarity can identify patent infringement. Semantic similarity between SAO structures is automatically measured using SAO based semantic similarity measurement method using WordNet, and the technological relationships among patents were mapped onto a 2-dimensional space using multidimensional scaling (MDS). Furthermore, a clustering algorithm is used to automatically suggest possible patent infringement cases, allowing large sets of patents to be handled with minimal effort by human experts.

Secondly, questionnaires, which are typically the means in which user's attitudes and perceptions are measured, are not typically subjected to rigorous reliability and validity testing. To address these issues, we administered the multidimensional User Engagement Scale (UES) in an exploratory search environment to assess users' perceptions of the Perceived Usability (PUs), Aesthetics (AE), Novelty (NO), Felt Involvement (FI), Focused Attention (FA), and Endurability (EN) aspects of the experience.

After a Principal Component Analysis is performed, a clear picture emerges: at the aggregate level ARWU seems to be a very reliable one-dimensional scale, with a first component that explains more than 72% of the variance of the sample under analysis. The percentages of variance of the indicators explained by the first component do shed light on the fact that ARWU is in fact measuring the research quality (both at the individual and collective levels) of a university system. When the second principal component is taken into account, the two principal components contribute to explain more than 90% of the variance. The rotated solution facilitates the interpretation of the components and provides clear and interesting clustering information about the 32 higher education systems under analysis.",0,57,2011,7,212,1.966,13,16,1,42,330,11

Database searches for emerging technologies can be problematic in many respects, for example the rapid evolution of terminology, the use of common phraseology, or the extent of ""legacy technology"" terminology. Searching on such legacy terms may or may not pick up R&D pertaining to the emerging technology of interest. A challenge is to assess the relevance of legacy terminology in building an effective search model. Common-usage phraseology additionally confounds certain domains in which broader managerial, public interest, or other considerations are prominent. In contrast, searching for highly technical topics is relatively straightforward. In setting forth to analyze ""Big Data,"" we confront all three challenges-emerging terminology, common usage phrasing, and intersecting legacy technologies. In response, we have devised a systematic methodology to help identify research relating to Big Data. This methodology uses complementary search approaches, starting with a Boolean search model and subsequently employs contingency term sets to further refine the selection. The four search approaches considered are: (1) core lexical query, (2) expanded lexical query, (3) specialized journal search, and (4) cited reference analysis. Of special note here is the use of a ""Hit-Ratio"" that helps distinguish Big Data elements from less relevant legacy technology terms. We believe that such a systematic search development positions us to do meaningful analyses of Big Data research patterns, connections, and trajectories. Moreover, we suggest that such a systematic search approach can help formulate more replicable searches with high recall and satisfactory precision for other emerging technology studies.",0,55,2015,4,292,2.084,20,18,4,34,255,9

On commercial blogs, the evaluation comments by bloggers of a product can spread at an explosive rate in cyberspace, and negative comments could be very harmful to an enterprise. Lately, researchers have been paying much attention to sentiment classification. The goal is to efficiently identify the emotions of their customers to allow companies to respond in the appropriate manner to what customers have to say. Semantic orientation indexes and machine learning methods are usually employed to achieve this goal. Semantic orientation indexes do not have good performance, but they return results quickly. Machine learning techniques provide better classification accuracy, but require a lot of training time. In order to combine the advantages of these two methods, this study proposed a neural-network based approach. It uses semantic orientation indexes as inputs for the neural networks to determine the sentiments of the bloggers quickly and effectively. Several actual blogs are used to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional approaches including other neural networks and several semantic orientation indexes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present work we propose a content-based technique to automatically generate a semantic representation of the user's musical preferences directly from audio. Starting from an explicit set of music tracks provided by the user as evidence of his/her preferences, we infer high-level semantic descriptors for each track obtaining a user model. To prove the benefits of our proposal, we present two applications of our technique. In the first one, we consider three approaches to music recommendation, two of them based on a semantic music similarity measure, and one based on a semantic probabilistic model. In the second application, we address the visualization of the user's musical preferences by creating a humanoid cartoon-like character - the Musical Avatar - automatically inferred from the semantic representation. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of the proposed technique in the context of these applications with 12 subjects. The results are promising: the recommendations were positively evaluated and close to those coming from state-of-the-art metadata-based systems, and the subjects judged the generated visualizations to capture their core preferences. Finally, we highlight the advantages of the proposed semantic user model for enhancing the user interfaces of information filtering systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Descriptive results show a global shift in science largely in quantity (papers) and much less in impact (citations). We argue this should be interpreted as a shift in science's absorptive capacity but not necessarily a shift of knowledge generation at the world science frontier, which reflects the nature of science systems operating with high inertia and path dependency in areas of their historically inherited advantages and disadvantages. In view of their common historical legacy in science we are particularly interested in the process of convergence/divergence of the catching-up/transition regions with the world frontier regions.

This framework specifically focuses on activity recognition using on-body accelerometer sensors. We present a novel interactive knowledge discovery tool for accelerometry in human activity recognition and study the sensitivity to the feature extraction parametrization. Results: The implemented framework achieved encouraging results in human activity recognition. We have implemented a new set of features extracted from wearable sensors that are ambitious from a computational point of view and able to ensure high classification results comparable with the state of the art wearable systems (Mannini et al. 2013). A feature selection framework is developed in order to improve the clustering accuracy and reduce computational complexity.(1) Several clustering methods such as K-Means, Affinity Propagation, Mean Shift and Spectral Clustering were applied. The K-means methodology presented promising accuracy results for person-dependent and independent cases, with 99.29% and 88.57%, respectively. Conclusions: The presented study performs two different tests in intra and inter subject context and a set of 180 features is implemented which are easily selected to classify different activities.

In this paper we perform aggregation experiments in each of the four stages and two fundamental conclusions are reached: (1) the system accuracy does not vary significantly according to the stage where the aggregation is performed, (2) the system performance improves notably when the aggregation is performed in an earlier stage of the collaborative filtering process.

Five different technological fields (computed tomography, solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, electric capacitors, electrochemical batteries) are used to test and demonstrate the proposed method. Comparison against traditional keyword searches and individual patent class searches shows that the method presented in this paper can find a set of patents with more relevance and completeness and no more effort than the other two methods. Follow on procedures to potentially improve the relevancy and completeness for specific domains are also defined and demonstrated.

Moreover, there remain many questions as to the real-world applicability of these empirical models. In the first part of this study we design novel stock price prediction models, based on state-of-the-art text-mining techniques to assert whether we can predict the movement of stock prices more accurately by including indicators of irrationality.

However, the performance of traditional topic detection methods is still far from perfect largely owing to the tweets' features, such as their limited length and arbitrary abbreviations. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework (MVTD) for Twitter topic detection using multiview clustering, which can integrate multirelations among tweets, such as semantic relations, social tag relations and temporal relations. We also propose some methods for measuring relations among tweets. In particular, to better measure the semantic similarity of tweets, we propose a new document similarity measure based on a suffix tree (STVSM). In addition, a new keyword extraction method based on a suffix tree is proposed. Experiments on real datasets show that the performance of MVTD is much better than that of a single view, and it is useful for detecting topics from Twitter.",0,37,2014,4,218,1.158,8,16,4,38,561,14

The limitations arise from the most current patents and patents that do not require citations, e.g. Korean patents. Further, few or no studies have simultaneously considered both coreness and intermediarity. Therefore, we propose a patent co-classification based method to measure coreness and intermediarity of technology sectors by incorporating the analytic network process and the social network analysis. Using IPC co-classifications of patents as technological knowledge flows, this method constructs a network of directed knowledge flows among technology sectors and measures the long-term importance and the intermediating potential of each technology sector, despite the limitations of patent-based analyses. Considering both coreness and intermediarity, this method can provide more detailed and essential knowledge for decision making in planning national R&D.

They therefore resort to advice from more experienced lecturers, to formal training processes such as specializations, master or doctoral degrees, or to self-training. High costs in time and money are invariably involved in the processes of formal training, while self-training and advice each bring their own specific risks (e.g. of following new trends that are not fully evaluated or the risk of applying techniques that are inappropriate in specific contexts).This paper presents a system that allows lecturers to define their best teaching strategies for use in the context of a specific class. The context is defined by: the specific characteristics of the subject being treated, the specific objectives that are expected to be achieved in the classroom session, the profile of the students on the course, the dominant characteristics of the teacher, and the classroom environment for each session, among others. The system presented is the Recommendation System of Pedagogical Patterns (RSPP). To construct the RSPP, an ontology representing the pedagogical patterns and their interaction with the fundamentals of the educational process was defined. A web information system was also defined to record information on courses, students, lecturers, etc.; an option based on a unified hybrid model (for content and collaborative filtering) of recommendations for pedagogical patterns was further added to the system. RSPP features a minable view, a tabular structure that summarizes and organizes the information registered in the rest of the system as well as facilitating the task of recommendation. The data recorded in the minable view is taken to a latent space, where noise is reduced and the essence of the information contained in the structure is distilled. This process makes use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), commonly used by information retrieval and recommendation systems.

Using panel data of 1279 solo-authored papers' citation histories and fixed effects models, we test these three effects controlling for unobserved paper characteristics. We find no evidence of retroactive networking effect and only weak evidence of prestige effect (very small and not always significant), which provides some support for the use of citation-based metrics in science studies and evaluation practices.

Three different collaborative types, namely local (same city), domestic (different cities of the same country), and international collaboration, are discussed. The general status of solar cell patent collaborations, transforming trends of collaborative patterns, average numbers of assignees and inventors for three collaborative types, and international collaboration countries are studied. It is found that co-invented patents and co-assigned patents have both increased in numbers during the four decades studied, and that collaboration between technology owners is very low while the collaboration between inventors is active. Domestic collaboration is the main collaborative pattern for both assignee collaboration and inventor collaboration. The other two collaborative types show contrary trends: international collaboration has slowly risen in the past decades while local collaboration has dwindled. The US has the largest number of internationally collaborative patents worldwide, though such patents account for a low portion of total US patents. In contrast, China has a small total number of patents and internationally collaborative patents, however its international collaborative shares are higher. The international collaboration patents among countries are few. A co-assigned patent analysis indicates that the main international cooperation partner of the United States is Japan.

The organization should: be open to change; encourage and value free communication and new and/or unusual ideas; tolerate mistakes; and nurture intrinsically motivated staff. It should be supported by leaders who promote these characteristics as shared values, while challenging and empowering their staff to generate new ideas in a drive to further innovation. Further analysis of focus group and interview data in the same case study identified three main determinants that underpin knowledge creation and creativity: (1) structured 'space' that creates expertise and experience of individuals while working in routine; (2) willingness to innovate - individuals' propensity to experiment with ideas, even at risk of failure; and (3) authorized and dedicated 'space' designated specifically for individuals to explore new ideas ('Freiraum'). These findings have contributed to the development of a new articulation of the organization of creativity and innovation.

Several approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple position and word-frequency methods, to learning and graph based algorithms. The advent of human-generated knowledge bases like Wikipedia offer a further possibility in text summarization - they can be used to understand the input text in terms of salient concepts from the knowledge base. In this paper, we study a novel approach that leverages Wikipedia in conjunction with graph-based ranking. Our approach is to first construct a bipartite sentence-concept graph, and then rank the input sentences using iterative updates on this graph. We consider several models for the bipartite graph, and derive convergence properties under each model. Then, we take up personalized and query-focused summarization, where the sentence ranks additionally depend on user interests and queries, respectively. Finally, we present a Wikipedia-based multi-document summarization algorithm. An important feature of the proposed algorithms is that they enable real-time incremental summarization - users can first view an initial summary, and then request additional content if interested. We evaluate the performance of our proposed summarizer using the ROUGE metric, and the results show that leveraging Wikipedia can significantly improve summary quality. We also present results from a user study, which suggests that using incremental summarization can help in better understanding news articles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The descriptive results show that there are significant differences in the production of academic scientific papers between less-favoured regions and core regions. However, the intensity of collaboration is similar in both types of regions. Our econometric findings suggest that differences in scientific resources (as measured by R&D expenditure) between regions are relevant in explaining academic scientific collaborations, while distance in the level of development (as measured by per capita GDP) does not appear to play any significant role.

In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving collaborative filtering scheme based on bisecting k-means clustering in which we apply two preprocessing methods. The first preprocessing scheme deals with scalability problem by constructing a binary decision tree through a bisecting k-means clustering approach while the second produces clones of users by inserting pseudo-self-predictions into original user profiles to boost accuracy of scalability-enhanced structure. Sparse nature of collections are handled by transforming ratings into item features-based profiles.

To test our hypotheses, we conducted an expert survey based on our science linkage calculation in the domain of catalyst from U. S. patent data (2006-2009) over 3 types of citations: self-citation by inventor/applicant, non-self-citation by inventor/applicant, and citation by examiner.

This feature has been assumed as causing positive effects on the use of online information services through enhancing user satisfaction. However, unlike other online information services (non-participatory information services), due to the results of personalization in a certain situation, SNS users cannot help using the SNS even though they feel dissatisfaction on using it. SNSs are different from other information services in the sense that they create and sustain their own value based on the number of participating members. In SNSs, personalization, reflected by updates and maintenance of profile pages, results in such participation. This study hypothesizes that personalization influences on the continued use of SNSs through two factors: switching cost (extrinsic factor) and satisfaction (intrinsic factor). Web-based survey was conducted with the samples of 677 SNS users from six universities in the US. In-person interviews were conducted with 25 university students to elicit their thoughts on the SNSs. Quantitative analysis employed by testing the proposed model with five hypotheses through a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The transcribed interview data was analyzed following the constant comparative technique. The main findings indicate that, as expected, the personalization increases its switching cost as well as satisfaction, which results in further use of SNSs. These findings suggest that it is necessary to consider both extrinsic and intrinsic factors of user perceptions when adding personalization features on SNSs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this way, the numbers of samples in different categories can become more balanced and the performance of text categorization can be improved using this transformed data set. Indeed, the proposed method is different from traditional re-sampling methods, which try to balance the number of documents in different classes by re-sampling the documents in rare classes. Such re-sampling methods can cause overfitting. Another benefit of our approach is the effective handling of noisy samples.

From the results obtained it may be concluded that, with the aid of our proposals, the QA system performs much better with CN-based questions when semantic information is used (semantic information F(beta=1) = 74.73% vs. NE F(beta=1) = 12.19%). Moreover, the more semantic information the system uses, the better the precision and correctness of the answer it achieves. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The idea of the proposed method is based on embedding the watermark with the SVD algorithm in the reflectance component after applying the homomorphic transform. The reflectance component contains most of the image features but with low energy, and hence watermarks embedded in this component will be invisible. A block-by-block implementation of the proposed method is also introduced. The watermark embedding on a block-by-block basis makes the watermark more robust to attacks. A comparison study between the proposed method and the traditional SVD watermarking method is presented in the presence of attacks. The proposed method is more robust to various attacks. The embedding of chaotic encrypted watermarks is also investigated in this paper to increase the level of security. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0,27,2014,4,155,1.265,9,15,10,10,63,4

Our study presents an empirical analysis concerning the recruitment procedures for associate professors in the Italian university system. The results of a bibliometric analysis of the hard science areas reveal that new associate professors are on average more productive than the incumbents.

Shannon's (1948) mathematical theory of communication because ""information"" is defined in the latter case as meaningless uncertainty. Assuming that meaning cannot be communicated, we extend Shannon's theory by defining mutual redundancy as a positional counterpart of the relational communication of information. Mutual redundancy indicates the surplus of meanings that can be provided to the exchanges in reflexive communications. The information is redundant because it is based on ""pure sets"" (i.e., without subtraction of mutual information in the overlaps). We show that in the three-dimensional case (e. g., of a triple helix of university-industry-government relations), mutual redundancy is equal to mutual information (R-xyz = T-xyz); but when the dimensionality is even, the sign is different. We generalize to the measurement in N dimensions and proceed to the interpretation. Using Niklas Luhmann's (1984-1995) social systems theory and/or Anthony Giddens's (1979, 1984) structuration theory, mutual redundancy can be provided with an interpretation in the sociological case: Different meaning-processing structures code and decode with other algorithms. A surplus of (""absent"") options can then be generated that add to the redundancy.

In this article, we introduce an associative author name disambiguation approach that identifies authorship by extracting, from training examples, rules associating citation features (e.g., coauthor names, work title, publication venue) to specific authors. As our main contribution we propose three associative author name disambiguators: (1) EAND (Eager Associative Name Disambiguation), our basic method that explores association rules for name disambiguation; (2) LAND (Lazy Associative Name Disambiguation), that extracts rules on a demand-driven basis at disambiguation time, reducing the hypothesis space by focusing on examples that are most suitable for the task; and (3) SLAND (Self-Training LAND), that extends LAND with self-training capabilities, thus drastically reducing the amount of examples required for building effective disambiguation functions, besides being able to detect novel/unseen authors in the test set.

Empirical result shows that the small world network may only have significant impact on patent productivity in those patent productive provinces, e.g., Beijing and Guangdong that filed larger number of patents. Although the collaborations in the network are more endurable in China than ones in western countries, it may be less efficient in transmitting knowledge because of large ratio of administration oriented state owned enterprises (SOEs). With larger ratio of SOEs, the small world network has longer path length and knowledge thus flows less efficiently in Beijing than in Guangdong.

These two components form a useful definition of a technology that allows for objective, repeatable and thus comparable analysis of specific technologies. 28 technological domains are investigated: the extension of an earlier technique is shown to be capable of finding highly relevant and complete patent sets for each of the technologies. Overall, about 500,000 patents from 1976 to 2012 are classified into these 28 domains. The patents in each of these sets are not only highly relevant to the domain of interest but there are relatively low numbers of patents classified into any two of these domains (total patents classified in two domains are 2.9 % of the total patents and the great majority of patent class pairs have zero overlap with a few of the 378 patent class pairs containing the bulk of the doubly listed patents).

However, the perceived level of creativity expected in work environments was not associated with serendipity. In addition, while extraverted people may be more likely to experience serendipity in general, those who are open to experience or have an external locus of control are no more likely to experience serendipity than their counterparts. Notable from our findings was a failure in identifying individual differences that may influence a person's likelihood to experience serendipity, in contrast with our success in identifying how the environment in which the user is immersed may create a fertile environment for serendipity to occur.

Ten human judges evaluate independently whether each story is deceptive and assign their confidence levels (360 evaluations total), producing measures of the expected human ability to recognize deception. As a robustness check, a test sample of 18 truthful stories (with 180 additional evaluations) is used to determine the reliability of our RST-VSM method in determining deception. The contribution is in demonstration of the discourse structure analysis as a significant method for automated deception detection and an effective complement to lexicosemantic analysis. The potential is in developing novel discourse-based tools to alert information users to potential deception in computer-mediated texts.",0,24,2015,1,209,1.864,8,13,2,35,941,12

The present study tries to: determine the abstracts reading level; discover the difference in the abstracts reading level among various disciplines; check the changes in the reading level of the abstracts during the examined years; test the correlation between the readability of the abstracts and their scientific impact. The results revealed that the texts of the abstracts are very difficult to read. Although this fact is true for all disciplines, disciplines can be divided into two groups based on their reading level, with some clearly less readable than others. No considerable change was observed in the readability scores of the abstracts over the examined years. Although the results of this research indicate that academics always write their abstracts in a difficult manner, these findings may result from the limitations in the readability formulas. Some researchers argue that these formulas ignore the readers' prior knowledge, interest and motivation and, based on the findings, it is clear that academics do tolerate such apparently difficult texts (RE score).",0,23,2011,5,234,1.299,19,9,1,20,406,7

Moreover, CBIR typically ranks the whole collection, which is inefficient for large databases. We experiment with a method for image retrieval from multimedia databases, which improves both the effectiveness and efficiency of traditional CBIR by exploring secondary media. We perform retrieval in a two-stage fashion: first rank by a secondary medium, and then perform CBIR only on the top-K items. Thus, effectiveness is improved by performing CBIR on a 'better' subset. Using a relatively 'cheap' first stage, efficiency is also improved via the fewer CBIR operations performed. Our main novelty is that K is dynamic, i.e. estimated per query to optimize a predefined effectiveness measure. We show that our dynamic two-stage method can be significantly more effective and robust than similar setups with static thresholds previously proposed. In additional experiments using local feature derivatives in the visual stage instead of global, such as the emerging visual codebook approach, we find that two-stage does not work very well. We attribute the weaker performance of the visual codebook to the enhanced visual diversity produced by the textual stage which diminishes codebook's advantage over global features. Furthermore, we compare dynamic two-stage retrieval to traditional score-based fusion of results retrieved visually and textually. We find that fusion is also significantly more effective than single-medium baselines. Although, there is no clear winner between two-stage and fusion, the methods exhibit different robustness features; nevertheless, two-stage retrieval provides efficiency benefits over fusion.

Data were collected employing a quasi-experiment and a web survey at a large public university in the Midwestern United States in the fall of 2011. The study participants consisted of undergraduate students from nine courses whose instructors agreed to their participation. A total of 142 students participated in the study, of which a total of 138 surveys were useable. The major findings of this study include the following: a peripheral cue and knowledge influenced the credibility judgments of college students concerning Wikipedia. The effect of a peripheral cue on credibility judgments was not different between those with high versus low knowledge. Finally, perceived credibility was positively related to heuristic processing, but knowledge, cognitive workload or involvement in a topic was not. This study suggests that educators and librarians need to integrate heuristic approaches into their literacy programs, guiding students to effectively use and not blindly accept cues. Wikipedia needs to offer noticeable cues that can help Wikipedia readers assess the credibility of information. The role of perceptions in heuristic processing needs further investigation. Further, this study demonstrates the strength of a peripheral cue on credibility judgments, suggesting that further research is needed when cues lead to effective credibility judgments and when cues lead to biased credibility judgments.

Based on the production frontier, we do not only estimate technical efficiency and scale efficiency for each country but also investigate and verify whether returns-to-scale of each country are decreasing or increasing. Furthermore, we add together the radial movement and the slack movement to acquire input redundancy. We decompose the input redundancy into two parts: redundancy caused by technical inefficiency (R_TI) and redundancy caused by scale inefficiency (R_SI), and carry out a detail analysis of the input redundancy. We find specific circumstances of inefficiency and redundancy vary with the different countries' characteristics and development stages.

However, since most recent works regarding sentiment classification have been done in the English language, there are accordingly not enough sentiment resources in other languages. Manual construction of reliable sentiment resources is a very difficult and time-consuming task. Cross-lingual sentiment classification aims to utilize annotated sentiment resources in one language (typically English) for sentiment classification of text documents in another language. Most existing research works rely on automatic machine translation services to directly project information from one language to another. However, different term distribution between original and translated text documents and translation errors are two main problems faced in the case of using only machine translation. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel learning model based on active learning and semi-supervised co-training to incorporate unlabelled data from the target language into the learning process in a bi-view framework. This model attempts to enrich training data by adding the most confident automatically-labelled examples, as well as a few of the most informative manually-labelled examples from unlabelled data in an iterative process. Further, in this model, we consider the density of unlabelled data so as to select more representative unlabelled examples in order to avoid outlier selection in active learning. The proposed model was applied to book review datasets in three different languages. Experiments showed that our model can effectively improve the cross-lingual sentiment classification performance and reduce labelling efforts in comparison with some baseline methods.

To overcome the issues of ignoring possible instability and hence, falsely assuming a constant relationship through the years, we use bootstrapped Granger non-causality tests with fixed-size rolling-window to analyze time-varying causal links between two series. Instead of just performing causality tests on the full sample which assumes a single causality relationship, we also perform Granger causality tests on the rolling sub-samples with a fixed-window size. Unlike the full-sample Granger causality test, this method allows us to capture any structural shifts in the model, as well as, the evolution of causal relationships between sub-periods, with the bootstrapping approach controlling for small-sample bias. Full-sample bootstrap causality tests reveal no causal relationship between research and growth in the US. Further, parameter stability tests indicate that there were structural shifts in the relationship, and hence, we cannot entirely rely on full-sample results.

The motivation behind the creation of this architecture is to allow users to define recommendation algorithms through the API and then customize their execution using job distribution strategies, without modifying the original algorithm. Thus, algorithms can be programmed and evaluated without the burden of thinking about distribution and parallel concerns, while still supporting environment-level tuning of the distributed execution. To validate the proposal, the current implementation of the architecture was tested using a followee recommendation algorithm for Twitter as case study. These experiments illustrate the graph API, quantitatively evaluate different job distribution strategies w.r.t. recommendation time and resource usage, and demonstrate the importance of providing non-invasive tuning for recommendation algorithms.",0,19,2015,6,259,0.878,13,19,5,14,172,7

In this paper, we present an in-depth examination of the relationship between social tagging and controlled vocabulary-based indexing and organization in two unique contexts: the information science domain and when comparing data gathered from both English and Chinese sources. Our results show that the information science domain has more overlap between social tags and controlled vocabulary-based subject terms. This is reflected in the higher percentage of overlapping terms between tags and subject terms, as well as in the strong similarity (measured by Jaccard's coefficient) in frequently used keywords among tags and subject terms. However, social tags in the information science domain still possess limitations in terms of uncontrolled terms, where inconsistencies and noisy usages exist. Our results also show that language difference does have an impact on social tagging. The numbers of Chinese tags overall and per book are less than those of English tags. The most frequently used English tags are single-word terms, which are different from multi-word controlled vocabulary terms. In comparison, the character difference between the most frequently used Chinese tags and Chinese subject terms is just one character (3 vs 4). However, English and Chinese users do share many similar behaviours when they tag books in the information science domain. Many of the most frequently used tags are shared between the two languages and the patterns of overlap between topical tags and subject terms are also similar between the two languages. Overall, despite the application limitations for social tagging in cataloguing and indexing, we believe that tagging has the potential to become a complementary resource for expanding and enriching controlled vocabulary systems.

We compared PIM and GIM in a large-scale elicited personal information retrieval study. We asked 275 users to retrieve 860 of their own shared files, testing the effect of sharing method on success and efficiency of retrieval. Participants preferred PIM over GIM. More important, PIM retrieval was more successful: Participants using GIM failed to find 22% of their files compared with 13% failures using PIM. This may be because active organization aids retrieval: When using personally created folders, the failure percentage was 65% lower than when using default folders (e.g., My Documents), and more than 5 times lower than when using folders created by others for GIM. Theoretical reasons for this are discussed.",0,18,2014,2,215,0,5,15,3,34,777,17

During the first step, real-world heuristics on coauthors are able to produce highly pure (although fragmented) clusters. The most representative of these clusters are then selected to serve as training data for the third supervised author assignment step. The third step exploits a state-of-the-art transductive disambiguation method capable of detecting unseen authors not included in any training example and incorporating reliable predictions to the training data. Experiments conducted with standard public collections, using the minimum set of attributes present in a citation, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms all representative unsupervised author grouping disambiguation methods and is very competitive with fully supervised author assignment methods. Thus, different from other bootstrapping methods that explore privileged, hard to obtain information such as self-citations and personal information, our proposed method produces topnotch performance with no (manual) training data or parameterization and in the presence of scarce information.",0,18,2014,1,213,0,8,22,4,27,568,11

The contribution of this paper consists in providing a classification of the approaches used for the conversion of XML documents into OWL ontologies. This classification underlines the usage profile of each conversion method, providing a clear description of the advantages and drawbacks belonging to each method. Hence, this paper focuses on two main processes, which are ontology enrichment and ontology population using XML data. Ontology enrichment is related to the schema of the ontology (TBox), and ontology population is related to an individual (Abox). In addition, the ontologies described in these methods are based on formal languages of the Semantic Web such as OWL (Ontology Web Language) or RDF (Resource Description Framework). These languages are formal because the semantics are formally defined and take advantage of the Description Logics. In contrast, XML data sources are without formal semantics. The XML language is used to store, export and share data between processes able to process the specific data structure. However, even if the semantics is not explicitly expressed, data structure contains the universe of discourse by using a qualified vocabulary regarding a consensual agreement. In order to formalize this semantics, the OWL language provides rich logical constraints. Therefore, these logical constraints are evolved in the transformation of XML documents into OWL documents, allowing the enrichment and the population of the target ontology. To design such a transformation, the current research field establishes connections between OWL constructs (classes, predicates, simple or complex data types, etc.) and XML constructs (elements, attributes, element lists, etc.). Two different approaches for the transformation process are exposed. The instance approaches are based on XML documents without any schema associated. The validation approaches are based on the XML schema and document validated by the associated schema. The second approaches benefit from the schema definition to provide automated transformations with logic constraints. Both approaches are discussed in the text.",0,18,2015,8,372,0.878,8,18,3,3,29,3

While it might seem obvious that science would regulate itself scientifically, the consensus on peer review is eroding; a deeper understanding of its workings and potential alternatives is sorely needed. Employing a theoretical approach supported by agent-based simulation, we examined computational models of peer review, performing what we propose to call redesign, that is, the replication of simulations using different mechanisms. Here, we show that we are able to obtain the high sensitivity to rational cheating that is present in literature. In addition, we also show how this result appears to be fragile against small variations in mechanisms. Therefore, we argue that exploration of the parameter space is not enough if we want to support theoretical statements with simulation, and that exploration at the level of mechanisms is needed. These findings also support prudence in the application of simulation results based on single mechanisms, and endorse the use of complex agent platforms that encourage experimentation of diverse mechanisms.",0,17,2014,6,195,2.183,13,26,2,59,611,13

Leading contributors, research collaboration and theoretical underpinnings in both domestic-oriented and international-oriented research are discussed. The review comprises 508 articles published in domestic Chinese journals indexed by the Chinese Social Science Citation Index and 189 articles published in international journals indexed by the Social Science Citation Index between 2000 and 2011. Two bibliometric approaches, co-authorship analysis and co-citation analysis, were utilized. The results indicate that entrepreneurship research in China is characterized by a clear division, not only in terms of researchers in each community, collaborating network but also with regard to theoretical foundation. Domestic-oriented research is still in its infancy. The research community has attracted a majority of Chinese researchers who focus on inter-institutional collaboration based on mentorship and directing relationship.

This presents a problem for public policy and university leadership, for example by blurring the pursuit of excellence with the quest for growth. This paper provides some insight into the size/excellence debate by exploring the explicit contribution of institutional size to the results of the Shanghai ranking indicators. Principal components analysis of data from the Shanghai ranking (2013 edition) is used to explore factors that contribute to the variation of the total score. The analysis includes the five non-derived ARWU indicators (Alumni, Award, HiCi, S&N and PUB) and uses the number of equivalent full-time academic staff (FTE) as a measure of size. Two significant but unequal factors are found, together explaining almost 85 % of the variance in the sample. A factor clearly associated with the size of the institution explains around 30 % of the variance. To sharpen the interpretation of the smaller factor as a measure of the effect of size, we extend the analysis to a larger set of institutions to eliminate size-dependent selection effects. We also show that eliminating outlying universities makes little difference to the factors. Our inferences are insensitive to the use of raw data, compared with the compressed and scaled indicators used by ARWU. We conclude that around 30 % of the variation in the ARWU indicators can be attributed to variation in size. Clearly, size-related factors cannot be overlooked when using the ranking results. Around 55 % of the variation arises from a component which is uncorrelated with size and which measures the quality of research conducted at the highest levels. The presence of this factor encourages further work to explore its nature and origins.",0,17,2015,6,308,2.084,15,22,2,42,330,11

Within this analysis, a biased editor is defined operationally as an editor that exerts a higher (lower) level of quality control. Here we show that if the editor is more biased than the manuscript's author then the author undertakes the type of revision that the editor prefers instead of following his or her own opinion. Moreover, authors with a strong belief about the required level of quality control will be very motivated under editors who agree with them. By contrast, when authors do not undertake the revision type that the editor prefers, they will be very demotivated under editors that exert a different level of quality control and more so as the associate editor is more biased. The effects of editors' bias on authors' satisfaction and motivation cause sorting in the authors who submit manuscripts to scholarly journals, and therefore, match authors and journals with similar quality standards. It will decrease the demotivating effect that editors' bias had on some authors, so that bias becomes more effective at the peer review stage. Moreover, some journals will be forced to lower the quality standards in order to be able to compete with journals of more biased editors.

This model is challenged by modern search engines and information retrieval (IR) researchers, who often consider Boolean retrieval a less efficient approach. The paper examines this claim and argues for the continued value of Boolean systems, and suggests two further considerations: (a) the important role of human expertise in searching (expert searchers and ""information literate"" users) and (b) the role of library and information science and knowledge organization (KO) in the design and use of classical databases. An underlying issue is the kind of retrieval system for which one should aim. Warner's (2010) differentiation between the computer science traditions and an older library-oriented tradition seems important; the former aim to transform queries automatically into (ranked) sets of relevant documents, whereas the latter aims to increase the selection power of users. The Boolean retrieval model is valuable in providing users with the power to make informed searches and have full control over what is found and what is not.

Movie summarization condenses a full-length movie into a summary that still retains the most significant and interesting content of the original movie. In the past, several movie summarization systems have been proposed to generate a movie summary based on low-level video features such as color, motion, texture, etc. However, a generic summary, which is common to everyone and is produced based only on low-level video features will not satisfy every user. As users' preferences for the summary differ vastly for the same movie, there is a need for a personalized movie summarization system nowadays. To address this demand, this paper proposes a novel system to generate semantically meaningful video summaries for the same movie, which are tailored to the preferences and interests of a user. For a given movie, shots and scenes are automatically detected and their high-level features are semi-automatically annotated. Preferences over high-level movie features are explicitly collected from the user using a query interface. The user preferences are generated by means of a stored-query. Movie summaries are generated at shot level and scene level, where shots or scenes are selected for summary skim based on the similarity measured between shots and scenes, and the user's preferences. The proposed movie summarization system is evaluated subjectively using a sample of 20 subjects with eight movies in the English language. The quality of the generated summaries is assessed by informativeness, enjoyability, relevance, and acceptance metrics and Quality of Perception measures. Further, the usability of the proposed summarization system is subjectively evaluated by conducting a questionnaire survey. The experimental results on the performance of the proposed movie summarization approach show the potential of the proposed system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The results obtained for English show that semantic knowledge aids in temporal expression and event recognition, achieving an error reduction of 59% and 21%, while in classification the contribution is limited. From the analysis of the results it may be concluded that the application of semantic knowledge leads to more general models and aids in the recognition of temporal entities that are ambiguous at shallower language analysis levels.

We argue that legislators should also remove structural barriers to interoperability by funding technical infrastructure according to issue clusters rather than administrative programs. As developers attempt to make government data more accessible through portals, they should consider a range of other nontechnical constraints attached to the data. We find that agencies react to the large number of constraints by mostly posting their data on their own websites only rather than in data portals that can facilitate sharing. Despite the nontechnical constraints, we find that scientists working in government agencies exercise some autonomy in data decisions, such as data documentation, which determine whether or not the data can be widely shared.

During the experiment, participants were asked to search Google to obtain information on the two given search tasks. Participants' primary emotions were inferred from analysis of their facial expressions, data on secondary emotions were obtained through participant interviews, and mood was measured using the Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) prior, during, and after the search. The search process was represented by the collection of search actions, search performance, and search outcome quality variables. The findings suggest existence of direct relationships between primary emotions and search actions, which in turn imply the possibility of inferring emotions from search actions and vice versa. The link between secondary emotions and searchers' evaluative judgments, and lack of evidence of any relationships between secondary emotions and other search process variables, point to the strengths and weaknesses of self-reported emotion measures in understanding searchers' affective experiences. Our study did not find strong relationships between mood and search process and outcomes, indicating that while mood can have a limited effect on search activities, it is a relatively stable and long-lasting state that cannot be easily altered by the search experience and, in turn, cannot significantly affect the search.

Although previous studies have proposed, designed and implemented temporal-aware systems and solutions, understanding of people's temporal information searching behaviour is still limited. This paper reports the findings of a user study that explored temporal information searching behaviour and strategies in a laboratory setting. Information needs were grouped into three temporal classes (Past, Recency, and Future) to systematically study their characteristics. The main findings of our experiment are as follows. (1) It is intuitive for people to augment topical keywords with temporal expressions such as history, recent, or future as a tactic of temporal search. (2) However, such queries produce mixed results and the success of query reformulations appears to depend on topics to a large extent. (3) Search engine interfaces should detect temporal information needs to trigger the display of temporal search options. (4) Finding a relevant Wikipedia page or similar summary page is a popular starting point of past information needs. (5) Current search engines do a good job for information needs related to recent events, but more work is needed for past and future tasks. (6) Participants found it most difficult to find future information. Searching for domain experts was a key tactic in Future search, and file types of relevant documents are different from other temporal classes. Overall, the comparison of search across temporal classes indicated that Future search was the most difficult and the least successful followed by the search for the Past and then for Recency information.

We propose recommending a group of relevant yet less-competitive keywords to an advertiser. Hence, the advertiser can get the chance to win some (originally empty) ad slots and accumulate a number of impressions. At the same time, the revenue of the search engine can also be boosted since many empty ad shots are filled. Mathematically, we model the problem as a mixed integer programming problem, which maximizes the advertiser revenue and the relevance of the recommended keywords, while minimizing the keyword competitiveness, subject to the bid and budget constraints. By solving the problem, we can offer an optimal group of keywords and their optimal bid prices to an advertiser. Simulation results have shown the proposed method is highly effective in increasing ad impressions, expected clicks, advertiser revenue, and search engine revenue. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In digital libraries, ambiguous author names occur due to the existence of multiple authors with the same name or different name variations for the same person.

The sizes of sequences can be large, making compression an interesting option. Effective compression presupposes variable-length coding, which destroys the regular alignment of values. Yet it would often be desirable to access only a small subset of the entries, either by position (ordinal number) or by content (element value), without having to decode most of the sequence from the start. Here such a random access technique for compressed integers is described, with the special feature that no auxiliary index is needed. The solution applies a method called interpolative coding, which is one of the most efficient non-statistical codes for integers. Indexing is avoided by address calculation guaranteeing sufficient space for codes even in the worst case. The additional redundancy, compared to regular interpolative coding, is only about 1 bit per source integer for uniform distribution. The time complexity of random access is logarithmic with respect to the source size for both position-based and content-based retrieval. According to experiments, random access is faster than full decoding when the number of accessed integers is not more than approximately 0.75. n/log(2)n for sequence length n. The tests also confirm that the method is quite competitive with other approaches to random access coding, suggested in the literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study finds that East Asia has the largest number of TCM papers, followed by North America and Europe. Furthermore, while China is ranked first in terms of the amount of TCM publications, USA gains the highest percentage of citations. As for regional specialty, mainly, scholars in East Asia publish intensively in Chinese medicine, while most of the scholars in North America and Europe probe into the study of acupuncture. In the latest two decades, China took the first place over Japan in subfields of both Chinese medicine and Chinese herb, while the US has always kept the largest share in acupuncture with a marked upward trend.

Existing approaches employ fairly simple features (e.g. empty referrer field, interval between successive requests), which often fail to reflect web robots' behaviour accurately. False alarms may therefore occur unacceptably often. In this paper we propose a fresh approach that expresses the behaviour of interactive users and various web robots in terms of a sequence of request types, called request patterns. Previous proposals have primarily targeted the detection of text crawlers, but our approach works well on many other web robots, such as image crawlers, email collectors and link checkers. In empirical evaluation of more than 1 billion requests collected at www.microsoft.com, our approach achieved 94% accuracy in web robot detection, estimated by F-measure. A decision tree algorithm proposed by Tan and Kumar was also applied to the same data.

The merits of phrasal-concept query suggestions for this domain are their readability and retrieval effectiveness: (1) phrasal concepts are natural for academic authors because of their frequent use of terminology and subject-specific phrases and (2) academic papers describe their key ideas via these subject-specific phrases, and thus phrasal concepts can be used effectively to find those papers.

However, in real world settings, collections and individual documents rarely stay unchanged over time. The World Wide Web is a prime example of a collection where information changes both frequently and significantly over time, with documents being added, modified or just deleted at different times. In this context, previous work addressing the summarization of web documents has simply discarded the dynamic nature of the web, considering only the latest published version of each individual document. This paper proposes and addresses a new challenge - the automatic summarization of changes in dynamic text collections. In standard text summarization, retrieval techniques present a summary to the user by capturing the major points expressed in the most recent version of an entire document in a condensed form. In this new task, the goal is to obtain a summary that describes the most significant changes made to a document during a given period. In other words, the idea is to have a summary of the revisions made to a document over a specific period of time. This paper proposes different approaches to generate summaries using extractive summarization techniques. First, individual terms are scored and then this information is used to rank and select sentences to produce the final summary. A system based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (LDA) is used to find the hidden topic structures of changes. The purpose of using the LDA model is to identify separate topics where the changed terms from each topic are likely to carry at least one significant change. The different approaches are then compared with the previous work in this area. A collection of articles from Wikipedia, including their revision history, is used to evaluate the proposed system. For each article, a temporal interval and a reference summary from the article's content are selected manually. The articles and intervals in which a significant event occurred are carefully selected. The summaries produced by each of the approaches are evaluated comparatively to the manual summaries using ROUGE metrics. It is observed that the approach using the LDA model outperforms all the other approaches. Statistical tests reveal that the differences in ROUGE scores for the LDA-based approach is statistically significant at 99% over baseline. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Much work on extractive summarization has been initiated for developing machine-learning approaches that usually cast important sentence selection as a two-class classification problem and have been applied with some success to a number of speech summarization tasks. However, the imbalanced-data problem sometimes results in a trained speech summarizer with unsatisfactory performance. Furthermore, training the summarizer by improving the associated classification accuracy does not always lead to better summarization evaluation performance. In view of such phenomena, we present in this paper an empirical investigation of the merits of two schools of training criteria to alleviate the negative effects caused by the aforementioned problems, as well as to boost the summarization performance. One is to learn the classification capability of a summarizer on the basis of the pair-wise ordering information of sentences in a training document according to a degree of importance. The other is to train the summarizer by directly maximizing the associated evaluation score or optimizing an objective that is linked to the ultimate evaluation. Experimental results on the broadcast news summarization task suggest that these training criteria can give substantial improvements over a few existing summarization methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, they have been popularly used for organizing and representing knowledge. However, constructing concept maps manually is a complex and time-consuming task. Therefore, the creation of concept maps automatically or semi-automatically from text documents is a worthwhile research challenge. Recently, various approaches for automatic or semi-automatic construction of concept maps have been proposed. However, these approaches suffer from several limitations. First, only the noun phrases in text documents are included without resolution of the anaphora problems for pronouns. This omission causes important propositions available in the text documents to be missed, resulting in decreased recall. Second, although some approaches label the relationship to form propositions, they do not show the direction of the relationship between the subject and object in the form of Subject-Relationship-Object, leading to ambiguous propositions. In this paper, we present a cluster-based approach to semi-automatically construct concept maps from text documents. First, we extract the candidate terms from documents using typed dependency linguistic rules. Anaphoric resolution for pronouns is introduced to map the pronouns with candidate terms. Second, the similarities are calculated between the pairs of extracted candidate terms of a document and clusters are made through affinity propagation by providing the calculated similarities between the candidate terms. Finally, the extracted relationships are assigned between the candidate terms in each cluster.

A framework for understanding KC with hermeneutic phenomenology is developed, based on an analysis of recent KC research and key texts on hermeneutic phenomenology. The results obtained indicate that recent KC research still emphasizes the concept of knowledge as an asset inside the human mind, although the interest is in knowing and interpersonal relationships in working communities. Exploration of the use of the effect of interaction in research on KC shows that successful interaction is connected to the ideas of openness, critical thinking, and awareness of past experiences. These elements reflect the general ideas of the hermeneutic tradition without taking into account the historical roots of hermeneutics or questioning the concept of a human being behind them. It is concluded that the hermeneutic circle and phenomenological conceptualization of a human being provide a better defined and more coherent structure for understanding the event of KC as a future-oriented, conscious act of interaction. The framework developed offers three fundamental areas for exploration: structure of the interactive event, construction of the human experience in interaction, and modes of being in interaction.",0,13,2014,1,215,0,12,16,2,6,25,3

While useful for policy makers, such rankings also furnish information on an institution's ""prestige"", which may in turn contribute to more effective resource capture (students, funding, projects). Certain university profiles and missions may prevent many universities from climbing to higher positions, however. One important question in this regard is: how many of a country's universities can stand at the top of international rankings? The present article attempts to answer this question on the grounds of a study of the Spanish higher education system, and more specifically of an institutional alliance consisting of four high quality universities. A series of research activity indicators drawn from the IUNE Observatory are used to compare this alliance to leading Spanish and international universities and explore whether their visibility and consequently their position in international rankings would be enhanced if they were able to appear under a joint identity. This prospective study also addresses a series of strategies that the Spanish higher education system might implement to successfully rise to the challenges posed by future scenarios.",0,12,2012,3,218,2.133,12,18,5,45,309,10

To analyze the drawbacks, the sample of countries with presence in ARWU is split into two groups of small and large world's GDP share. A raw indicator based upon the sum of the scores of all the universities from a country divided by its world's GDP share shows a noticeable bias in favor of small countries, so a one-way between-groups analysis of variance is conducted to help in canceling the bias. That leads to the introduction of a new aggregate indicator that can be computed in a very simple fashion.

In this paper, we propose a novel sentence selection strategy that follows a progressive way to select the summary sentences. We intend to ensure the coverage of the summary first by an intuitive idea, i.e., considering the uncovered concepts only when measuring the saliency of the sentences. Moreover, we consider the subsuming relationship between sentences to define a conditional saliency measure of the sentences instead of the general saliency measures used in most existing methods. Based on these ideas, a progressive sentence selection strategy is developed to discover the ""novel and salient"" sentences. Compared with traditional methods, the saliency and coverage issues are more integrated in the proposed method. Experimental studies conducted on the DUC data sets demonstrate the advantages of the progressive sentence selection strategy.

The mainstream software for assisting LRD is Arrowsmith. It uses text-based linkage to connect two disjoint literatures, and it generates intermediate linking literatures by matching Title phrases from two disjoint literatures (literatures that do not share common records). Arrowsmith then prioritizes these linking phrases through a series of text-based filters. The present study examines citation-based linkage in addition to text-based linkage to link disjoint literatures through a process called bibliographic coupling. Two disjoint literatures were selected for the demonstration: Parkinson's Disease (PD) (neurodegeneration) and Crohn's Disease (CD) (autoimmune). Three cases were examined: (1) matching phrases in records with no shared references (text-based linkage only); (2) shared references in records with no matching phrases (citation-based linkage only); (3) matching phrases in records with shared references (text-based and citation-based linkages). In addition, the main themes in the body of shared references were examined through grouping techniques to identify the common themes between the two literatures. All the high-level concepts in the Case 1) records could be found in Case 3) records Some new concepts (at the sub-set level of the main themes) not found in the Case 3) records were identified in the Case 2) records. The synergy of matching phrases and shared references provides a strong prioritization to the selection of promising matching phrases as discovery mechanisms. There were three major themes that unified the PD and CD literatures: Genetics; Neuroimmunology; Cell Death. However, these themes are not completely independent. For example, there are genetic determinants of the inflammatory response. Naturally occurring genetic variants in important inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha appear to alter inflammatory responses in numerous experimental and a few clinical models of inflammation.

These tag patterns are categorized into irrelevant patterns and relevant patterns which represent diverse user preferences in terms of likes and dislikes. Furthermore, presented here is a method for translating these tag-based profiles into semantic profiles by determining the underlying meaning(s) of the tags, and mapping them to semantic entities belonging to external knowledge bases. To alleviate the cold start and overspecialization problems, semantic profiles are enriched in two phases: (a) using a semantic spreading mechanism and then (b) inheriting the preferences of similar users. Experiment indicates that this approach not only provides a better representation of user interests, but also achieves a better recommendation result when compared with existing methods.

We demonstrate the characteristic results of average degree, diameter and clustering coefficient of diabetes micro-blog static structure. More importantly, we introduce a general model for micro-blog with directed network data, Exponential-family Random Graph Models (ERGMs). Meanwhile, we illustrate the utility for estimating, analysing and simulating micro-blog network. We also provide a goodness-of-fit approach to capture and reproduce the structure of the fitted micro-blog network. Parameter estimation of the model, similarity results of simulated networks and observed networks, and goodness of fit analysis for the micro-blog network all illustrate that ERGMs are excellent methods for deeply capturing complex network structures.",0,12,2014,4,215,1.158,10,12,2,20,144,8

Research shows that people conduct collaborative information searches while planning their travel activities online. However, little is known in depth about tourists' online collaborative search. This study examines tourists' collaborative information search behavior in detail, including their search stages, online search strategies, and information flow breakdowns. The data for analysis included pre- and postsearch questionnaires, web search and chat logs, and postsearch interviews. A model of tourist collaborative information retrieval was developed. The model identified collaborative planning, collaborative information searching, sharing of information, and collaborative decision making as four stages of tourists' collaborative search. The results show that tourists collaborated by planning their search strategies, dividing search tasks into subtasks and allocating workload, using search queries and URL links recommended by teammates, and discussing search results together. Related personal knowledge and experiences appeared important in trip planning and collaborative information search. During the collaborative search, tourists also encountered various information flow breakdowns in different search stages. These were classified and their effects on collaborative information search were reported.

Given a set of complex questions, a list of relevant documents per question, and the corresponding human generated summaries (i.e. answers to the questions) as training data, the reinforcement learning module iteratively learns a number of feature weights in order to facilitate the automatic generation of summaries i.e. answers to previously unseen complex questions. A reward function is used to measure the similarities between the candidate (machine generated) summary sentences and the abstract summaries. In the training stage, the learner iteratively selects the important document sentences to be included in the candidate summary, analyzes the reward function and updates the related feature weights accordingly. The final weights are used to generate summaries as answers to unseen complex questions in the testing stage. Evaluation results show the effectiveness of our system. We also incorporate user interaction into the reinforcement learner to guide the candidate summary sentence selection process.

The resulting query recommendation technique is very efficient and scalable, and is less affected by the data-sparsity problem than most state-of-the-art proposals. Thus, it is particularly effective in generating suggestions for rare queries occurring in the long tail of the query popularity distribution. The quality of suggestions generated is assessed by evaluating the effectiveness in forecasting the users' behavior recorded in historical query logs, and on the basis of the results of a reproducible user study conducted on publicly-available, human-assessed data.

However, it does not scale well with increasing index sizes and query traffic volumes because queries are evaluated on the entire web index, which has to be replicated and maintained in all data centers. As a remedy to this scalability problem, we propose a document replication framework in which documents are selectively replicated on data centers based on regional user interests.

A number of tasks in geo modifications were identified, including standard, multi-needs, multi-places, and hybrid approaches.

First, we demonstrate that the degree variance, and consequently the variance of the RN estimator, can grow almost linearly with data size for typical scale-free graphs. Then we prove that the RE estimator has a variance bounded from above. Therefore, the variance ratio between RN and RE samplings can be very large for big data. The analytical result is supported by both simulation studies and 18 real networks. We observe that the variance reduction ratio can be more than a hundred for some real networks such as Twitter.

Most rankings rely, to varying extent, on bibliometric indicators intended to capture the quantity and quality of the scientific output of institutions. The growing popularity of this practice has raised a number of concerns, one of the most important being whether evaluations of this sort treat different work styles and publication habits in an unbiased manner and, consequently, whether the resulting rankings properly respect the particular modes of research characteristic of various disciplines and subdisciplines. The research reported in this paper looked at this issue, using data on more than one hundred US sociology departments. Our results showed that institutions that are more quantitative in character are more likely to favor journals over books as the dominant form of scientific communication and fare, in general, considerably better on the National Research Council's assessment than their qualitative equivalents. After controlling for differences in publication practices, the impact of research style declined but remained statistically significant.

To compare the accuracy of the architecture with other statistical approaches, an SMT-like normalization system is implemented, trained, and evaluated with an identical parallel dataset.

We consider the example of a journal editor (the principal) wondering whether his or her reviewer (the agent) is recommending rejection of a manuscript because it does not have enough quality to be published or because the reviewer dislikes effort and he/she must work to acquire in-depth knowledge of the content of the manuscript. The reviewer's effort provides him or her with superior information about a manuscript's quality. If this information is not correctly communicated, the reviewer has more information when compared with the journal editor. This inherently leads to an encouragement of moral hazard, where the editor will not know whether the reviewer has done his or her job in accordance to the editor's interest. Prescriptions need to be given as to how the journal editor should control the reviewers to curb self-interest. Besides the associate editors monitoring the peer-review process, incentives can be employed to limit moral hazard on the part of the reviewer. Drawing on agency theory, we examine the incentives motivating the reviewers to expend effort to generate information about the quality of submissions.

At the core of these two conditions lies a novel metric that assesses the aggregate sentiment of a group of users and allows for estimating how close the behavior of influencers is to that of the entire community.

It represents the ratio (as %) between the number of all types of articles on a particular drug in the top 20 biomedical journals and the number of articles on that drug in all (> 5,000) journals covered by Medline over the first 5 years after a drug's introduction. For example, the highest TJSI score among analgesics was that of sumatriptan, the most successful drug for the treatment of migraine. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that TJSI may be used not only in the field of analgesics, but also for various other categories of drugs. The study tested two hypotheses. First, the difference between the most successful and less successful drugs in any pharmacological class can be reliably detected by TJSI. Second, drugs with TJSI indicators as high as that of sumatriptan can be found among other pharmacological classes as well. Drugs from various pharmacological classes approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) during the 10-year period, 1980-1989, were used in this study. Two groups of 10 drugs were selected to test the first hypothesis. One group included the most successful (breakthrough) drugs; the other included less successful drugs matched with the breakthrough drugs according to mechanism of action. The difference between the two groups was compared using three publication indices: the TJSI, the number of all types of articles on a drug in journals presented by Medline (AJI), and the number of articles covering only randomized controlled trials (RCT). It was found that TJSI can detect the difference between the two groups of drugs better than the two other indices. TJSI detected the difference between a breakthrough drug and its less successful counterpart at least 69% of the time with 95% confidence. With the other two indices the difference was not distinguishable from random chance. Some of the breakthrough drugs (zidovudine, omeprazole, lovastatin) have TSJIs as high or even higher than that of sumatriptan (19.2 vs. 23.0, 21.4, and 20.6, respectively).

To solve this problem, we propose a semantic collaborative filtering model that represents the semantics of users' preferences and items with their corresponding concepts. In this work, we extend the Bayesian belief network (BBN)-based model because it provides a clear formalism for representing users' preferences and items with concepts. Because the conventional BBN-based model regards the index terms derived from items as concepts, it does not exploit domain knowledge. We have therefore extended this conventional model to exploit concepts derived from domain knowledge.

Evidence suggests focusing on total quality management (TQM) and that innovation is the key way to effectively upgrade the operation performance and is thus highly advised. Although there are a number of measurement models for TQM and innovation, early models evaluate the performance of each element separately, making evaluation inefficient and inappropriate for practice. There is a new measurement system, the network hierarchical feedback system (NHFS), which integrates the concept and characteristics of both elements; however, the major concern is that the NHFS does not take external organization-oriented improvement into account, such as service quality in higher education, especially in innovation orientation. Additionally, due to the above dilemmas faced by Taiwanese universities, attracting more students has now been a major priority. Thus, we argue that in order to successfully attract potential students, improving TQM and innovation cannot just focus on internal organization-oriented improvement, and we further extend the effectiveness and suitability of the NHFS to a novel and more utilizable performance measurement system, the solid Inno-Qual performance system (IQPS). A hybrid model based on a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory, a fuzzy analytic network process (FANP), an importance-performance analysis along with in-depth interviews; a fuzzy analytic hierarchical process, and a technique for order preference according to similarity to an ideal solution were adopted to complete the construction.

Recently, tags chosen by users to annotate web resources are gaining significance for improving information retrieval (IR) tasks, in that they can act as meaningful keywords bridging the gap between humans and machines. One critical aspect of tagging (besides the tag and the resource) is the user (or tagger); there exists a ternary relationship among the tag, resource, and user. The traditional inverted index, however, does not consider the user aspect, and is based on the binary relationship between term and document. In this paper we propose a social inverted index - a novel inverted index extended for social-tagging-based IR - that maintains a separate user sublist for each resource in a resource-posting list to contain each user's various features as weights. The social inverted index is different from the normal inverted index in that it regards each user as a unique person, rather than simply count the number of users, and highlights the value of a user who has participated in tagging. This extended structure facilitates the use of dynamic resource weights, which are expected to be more meaningful than simple user-frequency-based weights. It also allows a flexible response to the conditional queries that are increasingly required in tag-based IR. Our experiments have shown that this user-considering indexing performs better in IR tasks than a normal inverted index with no user sublists.

This paper examines the crime domain in the Arabic language (unstructured text) using text mining techniques. The development and application of a Crime Profiling System (CPS) is presented. The system is able to extract meaningful information, in this case the type of crime, location and nationality, from Arabic language crime news reports. The system has two unique attributes; firstly, information extraction that depends on local grammar, and secondly, dictionaries that can be automatically generated. It is shown that the CPS improves the quality of the data through reduction where only meaningful information is retained. Moreover, the Self Organising Map (SOM) approach is adopted in order to perform the clustering of the crime reports, based on crime type. This clustering technique is improved because only refined data containing meaningful keywords extracted through the information extraction process are inputted into it, i.e. the data are cleansed by removing noise. The proposed system is validated through experiments using a corpus collated from different sources; it was not used during system development. Precision, recall and F-measure are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed information extraction approach. Also, comparisons are conducted with other systems. In order to evaluate the clustering performance, three parameters are used: data size, loading time and quantization error. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The 16 information sources were grouped into internal-external and personal-impersonal types. The participants rated the information sources according to five value criteria: relevancy, comprehensiveness, reliability, time/effort, and accessibility. Open-ended questions were also asked to get at how and why value attribution affected the participants' use of one information source over another during decision-making. Findings show that the participants preferred internal-personal type of information sources over external-impersonal information sources.

This paper presents a location-aware service application that develops a recommendation system (RS) for mobile short message advertising (LARSMA). The LARSMA prototype is developed through two stages: system parameter consultation and system development. System parameter consultation involves the collection of advertising categories and their attributes from store-owners and current interests and preferences from mobile phone users. Using a pull-oriented advertising model, system development involves the creation of the LARSMA prototype system, which allows storeowners to create and directly send short messages and mobile phone users within the defined area to automatically retrieve short messages that depend on their inputs. The implicit content-based recommendation mechanism embedded in the designed LARSMA performs filtering and comparison to derive the final top N formatted advertising messages as outputs of LARSMA. An application case is used to demonstrate the proposed LARSMA system prototype. Validation and evaluation are conducted, and feedbacks are addressed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, RF in TLIR actually not only can help select better query terms, but also can enhance query translation by adjusting translation probabilities and even resolving some out-of-vocabulary terms. In this paper, we propose a novel relevance feedback method called translation enhancement (TE), which uses the extracted translation relationships from relevant documents to revise the translation probabilities of query terms and to identify extra available translation alternatives so that the translated queries are more tuned to the current search. We studied TE using pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and interactive relevance feedback (IRF). Our results show that TE can significantly improve TLIR with both types of relevance feedback methods, and that the improvement is comparable to that of query expansion. More importantly, the effects of translation enhancement and query expansion are complementary. Their integration can produce further improvement, and makes TLIR more robust for a variety of queries.

Many previous studies of relevant sentence retrieval and novelty mining have been conducted on the English language, but few papers have addressed the problem of multilingual sentence categorization and novelty mining. This is an important issue in global business environments, where mining knowledge from text in a single language is not sufficient. In this paper, we perform the first task by categorizing Malay and Chinese sentences, then comparing their performances with that of English. Thereafter, we conduct novelty mining to identify the sentences with new information. Experimental results on TREC 2004 Novelty Track data show similar categorization performance on Malay and English sentences, which greatly outperform Chinese. In the second task, it is observed that we can achieve similar novelty mining results for all three languages, which indicates that our algorithm is suitable for novelty mining of multilingual sentences.

Referral to knowledge as an intangible asset appears more rhetorical than based on in-depth understanding of what knowledge as an organizational resource or capability is or is not. More particularly, the predominant view of knowledge in IC measurement discussions is a neo-functionalist, possession approach, even if flow elements of knowledge are used to supplement stock elements. Critical understanding of knowledge, for instance, as practice-based dispute, are virtually absent from the ICM discussions. What the blind spots identified in the review highlight is that ICM and KM discussions, which are presently mostly developed in isolation, should set up more meaningful and elaborated liaisons than are currently established.

In order to reduce computational complexity of learning non-local information, we further present an improved online training method, which can arrive the same objective optimum with a significantly accelerated training speed. We find that the proposed method can help the learning of long range dependencies and improve the segmentation quality of long words (for example, complicated named entities). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective.

The reason would appear to be the pressure to publish, coined by the expression ""Publish or perish"", which is, among other things, necessary for promotions and applications for grants or projects. In this paper we have conducted a study that covers computer science publications from 1936 to 2010 in order to quantify this increase in publications regarding computing research. We have considered the computing conferences and journals available in the DBLP computer science bibliography (DBLP 2013) database, including more than 1.5 million papers, and more than 4 million authors (more than 900,000 different people), corresponding to about 1,000 different journals and 3,000 different conferences and workshops. Our study confirms and quantifies these increases with regard to the number of papers, number of authors, number of papers per author, etc. However, it also reaches a surprising conclusion: the real productivity of researchers has decreased throughout history.

Exploratory video retrieval tasks are hampered by the lack of semantics associated to video and the overwhelming amount of video items stored in these types of collections (e.g. YouTube, MSN video, etc.). In order to help facilitate these exploratory video search tasks we present a system that utilises two complementary approaches: the first a new search paradigm that allows the semantic grouping of videos and the second the exploitation of past usage history in order to provide video recommendations. We present two types of recommendation techniques adapted to the grouping search paradigm: the first is a global recommendation, which couples the multi-faceted nature of explorative video retrieval tasks with the current user need of information in order to provide recommendations, and second is a local recommendation, which exploits the organisational features of ViGOR in order to provide more localised recommendations based on a specific aspect of the user task. Two user evaluations were carried out in order to (1) validate the new search paradigm provided by ViGOR, characterised by the grouping functionalities and (2) evaluate the usefulness of the proposed recommendation approaches when integrated into ViGOR. The results of our evaluations show (1) that the grouping, organisational and recommendation functionalities can result in an improvement in the users' search performance without adversely impacting their perceptions of the system and (2) that both recommendation approaches are relevant to the users at different stages of their search, showing the importance of using multi-faceted recommendations for video retrieval systems and also illustrating the many uses of collaborative recommendations for exploratory video search tasks.

In this study, we focus on explaining knowledge diffusion in the core technology used in fuel cells, i.e. the development of 5-layer membrane electrode assembly (MEA) technologies. Through an investigation of path analysis, this study explores how the knowledge of this technology has evolved and diffused across different locations. The empirical analysis also explains how certain technological knowledge plays a critical role in main path. In this study, patent data of 5-layer MEA technologies for fuel cells is collected from the US Patent Office, for a total of 1,356 patents, followed by constructing a patent citation network based on citation relationships, recognising prominent patents with many citations through path analysis. Using the local main path analysis and global key-route method, we identify three stages of technological development, including an improvement of the proton exchange membrane (PEM) and catalyst synthesis. Additionally, we use regression analysis to demonstrate that patents with specific characteristics play a vital role in the process of knowledge diffusion. Patents from Japan and South Korea are relatively more important than patents from other countries. The brokerage characteristics of a patent (e.g., coordinating domestically or liaising among three or more countries) also facilitate the diffusion of technological knowledge. However, the importance of these brokerages changes when we look at inventing time.

Given the complexity of academic productivity, it is necessary to clarify that it is divided into scientific productivity of the first type (scientific publications); scientific productivity of the second type (awards and academic positions); productivity in terms of external relationships (or external advice); and educational productivity. This objective of this paper is achieved through a sample survey (2,738 academics responded) conducted by Italian researchers from the PIR research project. The results obtained, however (as a case of estimates obtained using the results of a sample survey), are the result of a working reality that Italian academics are flooded by a myriad of activities that are not always consistent with the primary aims of the work of a researcher with an organisational and environmental well-being at the limit of iper productivity (or hyper productivity). The overall productivity (academic productivity) is significantly correlated with the four dimensions: average annual scientific productivity of the first type, average annual scientific productivity of the second type, the productivity external advice and, lastly, teaching productivity. The estimate of the sizes for the four indicators of productivity are the result of a literature search of the primary techniques used to assess productivity in academia. By comparing the most significant indicators, we managed to select all of the technical aspects missing in the Italian system of evaluation.

We show that the TSIM problem is NP-hard under these models but the spread function is monotone and submodular. Thus, a greedy approximation algorithm can achieve a 1-1/e approximation ratio. Moreover, we propose two time-sensitive centrality measures and compare their performance with the greedy algorithm. We evaluate our methods on four real-world datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methods, which ignore the decay of information value over time.",0,9,2015,5,216,0.878,6,14,3,6,74,3

Information diffusion, rumour spreading and diseases infection are all instances of stochastic processes that occur over the edges of social networks. Many prior works have carried out empirical studies and diffusion models to understand how information propagates in online social networks; however they suffer from problems. In this paper, we propose an information diffusion model inspired by information propagation among people. Our proposed Social Behavioural Information Diffusion Model, abbreviated as SBIDM, considers the effect of mainstream media like TV and radio, as well as interaction with the neighbours. The advantages of our approach are four-fold. First, it models information diffusion in social networks inspired by social life, which considers the effect of aggregate social behaviour to diffuse information; second, it allows partial knowledge to be held in each individual; third, it considers the effects of social media in propagating information as well as the effects of interacting with neighbours; and last but not least, it is applicable to different types of data including synthetic and well-known real social networks like Facebook, Amazon, Epinions and DBLP.

We propose basic yet novel optimizations to remedy these weaknesses and boost the performance of this algorithm. As a second contribution, inspired by the success of the current diversification strategies that exploit the relevance of the candidate documents to individual query aspects, we cast the diversification problem into the problem of ranking aggregation. To this end, we propose to materialize the re-rankings of the candidate documents for each query aspect and then merge these rankings by adapting the score(-based) and rank(-based) aggregation methods. Our extensive experimental evaluations show that certain ranking aggregation methods are superior to existing explicit diversification strategies in terms of diversification effectiveness.

While many data selection techniques have been proposed to improve the quality of training data for classification, the study on the same issue for ranking appears to be insufficient. As pointed out in this paper, it is inappropriate to extend technologies for classification to ranking, and the development of novel technologies is sorely needed. In this paper, we study the development of such technologies. To begin with, we propose the concept of ""pairwise preference consistency"" (PPC) to describe the quality of a training data collection from the ranking point of view. PPC takes into consideration the ordinal relationship between documents as well as the hierarchical structure on queries and documents, which are both unique properties of ranking. Then we select a subset of the original training documents, by maximizing the PPC of the selected subset. We further propose an efficient solution to the maximization problem. Empirical results on the LETOR benchmark datasets and a web search engine dataset show that with the subset of training data selected by our approach, the performance of the learned ranking model can be significantly improved.

A literature search in the field was conducted in MEDLINE (1966-2010) and LILACS (1980-2010) through BIREME's virtual health library. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to identify the type of documents produced, authorship, language of publication, check-tags, major subject content, journals used, and main participating institutions. Visibility was obtained through the identification of the document type used and the subject content, per database. Accessibility was limited to online full-text access. Only 6 (out of 30) health science descriptors under health public policy have emerged as relevant by all three countries in both databases; namely, health services accessibility; health care reform; decentralization; health systems; consumer participation and financing, health. References retrieved from MEDLINE corresponded to journal articles in all three countries. In LILACS monographs corresponded to over 40 %. Overall health public policy documents addressed adult female and male studies, with the exception of Argentina which addressed female and male children. Full-text accessibility was less than 25 % of total production. Health public policy research is in its infancy in Spanish speaking Latin America.

Because individual family members target different markets and technologies have a different propensity to internationalization, family size has been shown to have a restricted power to assess the quality of patent profiles of countries. We address this gap by weighting the members of patent families filed at different patent offices before calculating the family size indicators, to account for the market potential in which the patents of these families were filed. We apply different weighting schemes and test which scheme is best able to explain the export performance of countries. In order to conduct our analyses, a panel dataset, consisting of annual data (1990-2002) on international trade from the UN-COMTRADE database and patent data from the ""EPO Worldwide Patent Statistical Database"" (PATSTAT), was compiled. Several bivariate analyses reveal that weighted and unweighted family counts are highly correlated, meaning that statistics based on absolute (weighted or unweighted) family counts are barely affected by the chosen weighting factor. This, however, is different when using the average family size, where weighting the family members by imports, as well as GDP, can be shown to have a robust positive effect to explaining export performance. The imports and the GDP weighted average family size are thus able to act as a consistent indicator of patent value at the country and technology field level.",0,8,2013,5,267,2.274,15,23,2,21,168,7

Selective links constitute a variant of external links where both the source and target of the link can be selected. This paper intends to study the influence of social platforms (measured through the number of selective external links) on academic environments, in order to ascertain both the percentage that they constitute and whether some of them can be used as substitutes of total external links. For this purpose, 141 URLs belonging to 76 Spanish universities were compiled in 2010 (before Yahoo! stopped their link services), and the number of links from 13 selected social platforms to these universities were calculated. Results confirm a good correlation between total external links and links that come from social platforms, with the exception of some applications (such as Digg and Technorati). For those universities with a higher number of total external links, the high correlation is only maintained on Delicious and Wikipedia, which can be utilized as substitutes of total external links in the context analyzed.

This paper proposes a methodology to automatically detect verbose queries and conditionally modify queries. The methodology proposed in this paper exploits state-of-the-art classification algorithms, combines concepts from a large linguistic database and uses a topic gisting algorithm we designed for verbose query modification purposes. Our experimental results have been obtained using the TREC Robust track collection, thirty topics classified by difficulty degree, four queries per topic classified by verbosity and length, and human assessment of query verbosity. Our results suggest that the methodology for query modification conditioned to query verbosity detection and topic gisting is significantly effective and that query modification should be refined when topic difficulty and query verbosity are considered since these two properties interact and query verbosity is not straightforwardly related to query length.

The explanation commonly advanced for this phenomenon is that the distribution of Web server requests may be heavy-tailed. However, there is another possible explanation: self-similarity can also arise from deterministic, chaotic processes. To our knowledge, this possibility has not previously been investigated, and so existing studies on Web workloads lack an adequate comparison against this alternative. We conduct an empirical study of workloads from two different Web sites: one public university, and one private company, using the largest datasets that have been described in the literature. Our study employs methods from nonlinear time series analysis to search for chaotic behavior in the web logs of these two sites. While we do find that the deterministic components (i.e. the well-known ""weekend effect"") are significant components in these time series, we do not find evidence of chaotic behavior.

We studied a database made up of 49 European banks whose shares are included in the Dow Jones EURO STOXX TMI Banks [8300] Index. Regarding the factors for the implementation, we considered three feasible reasons. Firstly, WA adoption can be motivated by operational factors, as WA can aid in increasing operational efficiency. Secondly, we expect large banks to have higher WA levels, as small firms face competitive disadvantages with regard to technology adoption. Lastly, WA can also be understood as a part of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy, so, the more committed a bank is to CSR, the more prone it will be to implement WA. Our results indicate that neither the operational factors nor the firm size seem to have exerted a significant influence on WA adoption. Regarding CSR commitment, results indicate a significant influence on WA adoption. However, the effect of the influence is contrary to that hypothesized, since more CSR-committed banks have less accessible Web sites. A possible reason for this result is that banks not included in the CSR indexes try to overcome this drawback by engaging in alternative CSR activities such as WA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, simple use of these ontologies may raise the heterogeneity problem to a higher level. Addressing this problem requires identification of correspondences between the entities of various ontologies. Since the real semantics of a concept is often better defined by the actual instances assigned to it, instance, as an important element of ontology, contains a great quantity of knowledge that should be utilized to obtain the ontology alignment. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel instance-based aligning approach using NSGA-II to determine the optimal instance correspondences and a similarity propagation algorithm that makes use of various semantic relations to propagate the similarity values to other entities of ontologies.

Such judgments are absolute judgments. Learning to rank brings some new challenges to this traditional evaluation methodology, especially regarding absolute relevance judgments. Recently preferences judgments have been investigated as an alternative. Instead of assigning a relevance grade to a document, an assessor looks at a pair of pages and judges which one is better. In this paper, we generalize pairwise preference judgments to relative judgments. We formulate the problem of relative judgments in a formal way and then propose a new strategy called Select-the-Best-Ones to solve the problem. Through user studies, we compare our proposed method with a pairwise preference judgment method and an absolute judgment method. The results indicate that users can distinguish by about one more relevance degree when using relative methods than when using the absolute method. Consequently, the relative methods generate 15-30% more document pairs for learning to rank.

This paper captures the limitations of pseudo relevance feedback (PRF)-based query expansion and proposes a method of enhancing its performance by hybridizing corpus-based information, with a genetic fuzzy approach and semantic similarity notion. First the paper suggests use of a genetic fuzzy approach to select an optimal combination of query terms from a pool of terms obtained using PRF-based query expansion. The query terms obtained are further ranked on the basis of semantic similarity with original query terms. The experiments were performed on CISI collection, a benchmark dataset for information retrieval. It was found that the results were better in both terms of recall and precision. The main observation is that the hybridization of various techniques of query expansion in an intelligent way allows us to incorporate the good features of all of them.

Several methods have been developed to identify the results and impacts of programs of this kind. Most evaluations that adopt such an approach conclude that the interventions concerned, in this case ST&I programs, had a positive impact compared with the baseline, but do not control for any effects that might have improved the indicators even in the absence of intervention, such as improvements in the socio-economic context. The quasi-experimental approach therefore arises as an appropriate way to identify the real contributions of a given intervention.

One approach is to use n-grams in document representation instead of unigrams. However, the majority of early works on n-grams obtained only modest performance improvement. On the other hand, the use of information based on supporting terms or ""contexts"" of queries has been found to be promising. In particular, recent studies showed that using new context-dependent term weights improved the performance of relevance feedback (RF) retrieval compared with using traditional bag-of-words BM25 term weights. Calculation of the new term weights requires an estimation of the local probability of relevance of each query term occurrence. In previous studies, the estimation of this probability was based on unigrams that occur in the neighborhood of a query term. We explore an integration of the n-gram and context approaches by computing context-dependent term weights based on a mixture of unigrams and bigrams. Extensive experiments are performed using the title queries of the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC)-6, TREC-7, TREC-8, and TREC-2005 collections, for RF with relevance judgment of either the top 10 or top 20 documents of an initial retrieval. We identify some crucial elements needed in the use of bigrams in our methods, such as proper inverse document frequency (IDF) weighting of the bigrams and noise reduction by pruning bigrams with large document frequency values.

2041,2208,0,10.1016/j.joi.2014.05.003,1,disseminator,"Equalizing bias (EqB) is a systematic inaccuracy which arises when authorship credit is divided equally among coauthors who have not contributed equally. As the number of coauthors increases, the diminishing amount of credit allocated to each additional coauthor is increasingly composed of equalizing bias such that when the total number of coauthors exceeds 12, the credit score of most coauthors is composed mostly of EqB. In general, EqB reverses the byline hierarchy and skews bibliometric assessments by underestimating the contribution of primary authors, i.e. those adversely affected by negative EqB, and overestimating the contribution of secondary authors, those benefitting from positive EqB. The positive and negative effects of EqB are balanced and sum to zero, but are not symmetrical. The lack of symmetry exacerbates the relative effects of EqB, and explains why primary authors are increasingly outnumbered by secondary authors as the number of coauthors increases. Specifically, for a paper with 50 coauthors, the benefit of positive EqB goes to 39 secondary authors while the burden of negative EqB befalls 11 primary authors. Relative to harmonic estimates of their actual contribution, the EqB of the 50 coauthors ranged from < -90% to > 350%. Senior authorship, when it occurs, is conventionally indicated by a corresponding last author and recognized as being on a par with a first author. If senior authorship is not recognized, then the credit lost by an unrecognized senior author is distributed among the other coauthors as part of their EqB. The powerful distortional effect of EqB is compounded in bibliometric indices and performance rankings derived from biased equal credit. Equalizing bias must therefore be corrected at the source by ensuring accurate accreditation of all coauthors prior to the calculation of aggregate publication metrics. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Here, various morphological structures are explored to better represent the compositional semantics inside Chinese triggers and automatically identify the head morpheme as the governing sememe of a trigger in inferring unknown triggers.

The concept of CoPs was originally developed as a social learning theory, and CoPs were defined by their informal emergent nature. This informal nature has been recognized to be of value to organizations, resulting in a desire to design CoPs. In this article, the nature of CoPs is addressed by focusing on aspects of formality and informality in relationships and learning; CoPs are described as emergent and designed practices. Furthermore, it is questioned whether a designed CoP may realize the essential characteristics attributed to an emergent CoP. It is argued that it is crucial to recognize the informal nature of CoPs in order to either encourage them as informal phenomena or to use the concept of CoPs as inspiration for designing imitations of them. However, when attempting to design them, the original meaning of a CoP is lost, even though, in some cases, the consequences of such a design may be beneficial to organizations.

This author is of the opinion that for an accurate evaluation of the value of indices as a policy tool, it is necessary to consider the matter from the broader point of view and from the context in which such indices are generated and used. This article puts forward the thesis that progress in science and innovation policy studies depends on a diversity of issues, approaches and perspectives. If that is the case, maintaining thematic and methodological variety may be more important than creating coherent and closed analytical tools, i.e. indices. The advantage of indices is that they focus attention on those variables which are deemed to be key. Among their disadvantages, however, are their highly abstract nature (in order to understand innovation-related phenomena, it is necessary to study them in tangible, composite forms); their tendency to skip unmeasurable determinants; their prior acceptance of definitions and concepts of innovation (instead of searching for them); the way they apply a single yardstick to diverse countries and regions, assumed linearity and causality in a complex and non-linear world, the way they direct policy towards implementing indicators (rather than identifying and solving problems).

While recording cursor interactions can be done without disturbing the user, the overhead of recording the cursor trail and transmitting this data over the network can be substantial. In our work, we investigate methods to compress cursor data, taking advantage of the fact that not every cursor coordinate has equal value to the website developer.

It plays a critical role in event-based information extraction and thus is important for deep information processing and management. This paper proposes a tree kernel method for a particular shallow semantic parsing task, called semantic role labeling (SRL), with an enriched parse tree structure. First, a new tree kernel is presented to effectively capture the inherent structured knowledge in a parse tree by enabling the standard convolution tree kernel with context-sensitiveness via considering ancestral information of substructures and approximate matching via allowing insertion/deletion/substitution of tree nodes in the substructures. Second, an enriched parse tree structure is proposed to both well preserve the necessary structured information and effectively avoid noise by differentiating various portions of the parse tree structure. Evaluation on the CoNLL'2005 shared task shows that both the new tree kernel and the enriched parse tree structure contribute much in SRL and our tree kernel method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art tree kernel methods. Moreover, our tree kernel method is proven rather complementary to the state-of-the-art feature-based methods in that it can better capture structural parse tree information. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The frequency of a surname in the US population (1990 US Census) was used to calculate the expected number of scientific publications: the total number of published articles multiplied by a surname's frequency. The actual number of articles with that surname was also determined. The ratio of actual to expected number of articles was used as a measure of representation proportionality.

In conclusion, the representation of Jewish authors in top 10 US biomedical journals corresponds to the representation of Jewish Nobel Laureates among US laureates.

However, with the globalization of business environments and advances in Internet technology, an organization or individual may generate and organize into categories documents in one language and subsequently archive documents in different languages into existing categories, which necessitate cross-lingual text categorization (CLTC). Specifically, cross-lingual text categorization deals with learning a text categorization model from a set of training documents written in one language (e.g., LI) and then classifying new documents in a different language (e.g., L-2).

We show that a text self-index (i.e., an index that compresses the text and is able to extract arbitrary parts of it) can be competitive with an inverted index if we consider the whole query process, which includes index decompression, ranking and snippet extraction time. The advantage is that within the space of the compressed document collection, one can carry out the posting lists generation, document ranking and snippet extraction. This significantly reduces the total number of processors involved in the solution of queries. Alternatively, for the same amount of hardware, the performance of the proposed strategy is better than that of the classical approach based on treating inverted indexes and corresponding documents as two separate entities in terms of processors and memory space.

After reproducing each printed, digitized or web picture book as a surrogate picture book consisting of the front-cover image followed by the page images, we first introduce two basic notions: (i) an abstracted bookshelf, which presents the front-cover images of the surrogate picture books in the form where all are linearly arranged, with some of the images bundled in places, and (ii) a unified view, which presents each page of any surrogate picture book in a form that seems like a printed picture book's page. We then specify, based on these notions, the improved version of the Brows Reader which can be installed in each children's room so that children together with families and/or friends can easily browse a large number of surrogate picture books as if they are browsing in the physical bookshelves of the children's room, and can read a wide variety of surrogate picture books as if they are reading ordinary printed picture books on a table.

Information retrieval (IR) technologies are necessary for accessing the massive amounts of valuable user-generated contents in the microblog sphere. The challenge in searching relevant microblogs is that they are usually very short with sparse vocabulary and may fail to match queries. Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) via query-expansion has been proven in previous studies to successfully increase the number of matches in IR. However, a critical problem of PRF is that the pseudo-relevant feedback may not be truly relevant, and thus may introduce noise to query expansion. In this paper, we exploit the dynamic nature of microblogs to address this problem. We first present a novel dynamic PRF technique, which is capable of expanding queries with truly relevant keywords by extracting representative terms based on the query's temporal profile. Next we present query expansion from external knowledge sources based on negative and positive feedbacks. We further consider that the choice of PRF strategy is query-dependent. A two-level microblog search framework is presented. At the high level, a temporal profile is constructed and categorized for each query; at the low level, hybrid PRF query expansion combining dynamic and external PRF is adopted based on the query category.

Three bibliometric indicators are proposed for growth, activity profile stability, and focus. With these, the research dynamics of the case institute are described. First, overall output growth matches developments internationally in developmental biology and stem cell research, and, in line with this, journal article output increasingly dominates the institute's activity profile. Second, superposed on the overall growth curve, a stepwise development is observed, consisting of long phases of growth and stabilisation. These steps reflect local conditions and events. Historical sources from the Institutes' archive and interviews with the current staff of the institute suggest that the pattern of life cycles reflects a strong influence of pioneering individuals.

Active learning algorithms are able to reduce the labeling effort by selectively sampling an unlabeled set and choosing data instances that maximize a learning function's effectiveness. In this article, we propose a novel two-stage active learning method for L2R that combines and exploits interesting properties of its constituent parts, thus being effective and practical. In the first stage, an association rule active sampling algorithm is used to select a very small but effective initial training set. In the second stage, a query-by-committee strategy trained with the first-stage set is used to iteratively select more examples until a preset labeling budget is met or a target effectiveness is achieved. We test our method with various LETOR benchmarking data sets and compare it with several baselines to show that it achieves good results using only a small portion of the original training sets.",0,6,2014,1,203,0,9,20,3,26,237,10

These efforts were done with an eye for a potential literature-based discovery application that utilizes semantic predications. We performed a literature search, reviewed the results, and applied the findings in developing a model for serendipitous knowledge discovery as an information-seeking behavior.

The current search engines cater mostly to MSA. This means that materials written in colloquial are off-limits to those who use MSA, and similarly the MSA contents are off-limits for those who communicate in colloquial only.

This situation brings a great demand for efficient text analysis techniques by internet users. Since clustering is unsupervised and requires no prior knowledge, it is extensively adopted to help analyse textual data. Unfortunately, as far as I know, almost all the clustering algorithms proposed so far fail to deal with large-scale text collection. For precisely classifying large-scale text collection, a novel probability based text clustering algorithm by alternately repeating two operations (abbreviated as PTCART) is proposed in this paper. This algorithm just repeats two operations of (a) feature set construction and (b) text partition until the optimal partition is reached. Its convergent capacity is also validated.

This paper proposes an improved ranking model for question answering (QA) which is focused on various answer trustworthiness factors. Contrary to past research that simply focused on document quality, we have identified three different answer trustworthiness factors in multiple layers of answering processes: document quality, authority and reputation of answer sources, and appropriateness of answering method for a given question. Each of these factors is used in the answer selection as an input to the ranking scheme that can be tuned for the confidence value for a particular answer candidate. Through several experiments, we analysed the efficacy of our QA model from two points of view: indexing and answering. In indexing, distilling unreliable documents brings not only a 96% reduction in document size but also a 92% speed increase in indexing time. To reveal the effect of trustworthiness factors in answering, we conducted several experiments to determine the optimum combination of weights of sub-features for trustworthiness factors. Finally, the proposed method using all answer trustworthiness factors obtained an improvement in effectiveness over the simple routing QA by 150% in Top1.

To extract words from a sentence in these languages, we usually rely on a dictionary for known words. For unknown words, some approaches rely on a domain specific dictionary or a tailor-made learning data set. However, this information may not be available. Another direction is to use unsupervised methods. These methods rely on a goodness measure to evaluate how likely the words are meaningful based on a statistical argument on the given text. The most challenging issue is to identify low-frequency meaningful words. In this paper, we first show by an empirical study on Chinese texts that all classical goodness measures cannot separate low-frequency meaningful and meaningless words effectively. To solve this problem, we propose a new goodness measure, the overlap variety method. The key idea behind the new measure is not to consider the absolute number of occurrences of the candidate (i.e., a string of Chinese characters) but to compare the goodness measures (we use the accessor variety) of the candidate and those of the strings overlapping the candidate. The candidate is likely to be meaningful if its accessor variety is larger than the accessor varieties of the overlapping strings. We implement an extraction system for unknown Chinese word, UNExtract, based on this overlap variety method. We evaluate our approach using the CIPS-SIGHAN-2010 bake off corpora and show that the proposed measure is more effective than the other five state-of-the-art goodness measures (accessor variety, branch entropy, description length gain, frequency substring reduction, pointwise mutual information), especially for low-frequency words and bi-gram words.

Otherwise, the two groups did not differ in behavior and task performance, with participants in the Scatter/Gather group largely overlooking the features (key words, clusters, and the recluster function) designed to facilitate the exploration of semantic relationships between information objects, a potentially useful means for users in the rather unfamiliar domain of health. The results suggest a strong effect of users' mental models of search on their use of search interfaces and a high cognitive cost associated with using the Scatter/Gather features. It follows that novel features of a search interface should not only be compatible with users' mental models but also provide sufficient affordance to inform users of how they can be used.

The analysis of author references shows that if core scientific journals are arranged in order of decreasing productivity, then they could be divided into a small group of highly cited periodicals and a large group of minimally cited ones. Scholars may do browsing and similar information-seeking activities to form their core journals, and the findings may support Bates's hypothesis that Bradford's core zone is best searched by browsing.

The objective of the study is to develop a model for internationalization of universities with the transformation of some promising macroeconomic variables i.e., educational reforms and economic growth in the seven largest regions of the world [namely, East Asia and Pacific (sample 25 countries); Europe and Central Asia (40 countries); Latin America and Caribbean (27 countries); Middle East and North Africa (17 countries); North America (22 countries); South Asia (7 countries) and Sub-Saharan Africa (21 countries)]. The data has been analyzed by panel fixed effect regression from the period of 1990-2011. In addition to transform inputs into output, the study employed eleven indicators of education and five indicators for growth, where the resulting vector is internationalization. The results show the dynamic linkages between educational indicators and economic factors in the selected regions of the World. In East Asia and Pacific region, tertiary and higher education expenditures per student increase the economic factors. Higher education is a powerful driver of long-term growth in Europe and Central Asia. Governments of the state should have to focus on higher education enrolment, as it does not have any significant contribution to increase GDP; gross capital formation and FDI in Latin America and Caribbean region. Higher education enrolment in MENA region significantly increases growth factors on the cost of increase gross national expenditures. Investment in general education and other generic human capital is of the utmost importance in creating an enabling environment for FDI in North America. It is imperative for South Asia to encourage the skill levels and education opportunities for females, in order to maximize the effects of FDI on the female human capital stock and therefore economic growth.

Second, current automatic concept relation extraction methods mainly rely on the local context information that surrounds current considered concepts. These two problems prevent most current ontology construction methods from being employed to their full potential. To tackle these problems, we propose a hybrid learning method to integrate concepts' global information and human experts' knowledge together into ontology construction, among which concepts' temporal attributes are taken into account. Our method first divides each concept into four time periods according to their attribution distribution on a time axis. Then global time-related attributions are collected for each concept.

A stream of documents arriving over time is filtered for documents relevant to a set of topics. The distinguishing feature of document filtering is the temporal aspect introduced by the stream of documents. Document filtering systems, up to now, have been evaluated in terms of traditional metrics like (micro- or macro-averaged) precision, recall, MAP, nDCG, F1 and utility. We argue that these metrics do not capture all relevant aspects of the systems being evaluated. In particular, they lack support for the temporal dimension of the task. We propose a time-sensitive way of measuring performance of document filtering systems over time by employing trend estimation. In short, the performance is calculated for batches, a trend line is fitted to the results, and the estimated performance of systems at the end of the evaluation period is used to compare systems. We detail the application of our proposed trend estimation framework and examine the assumptions that need to hold for valid significance testing. Additionally, we analyze the requirements a document filtering metric has to meet and show that traditional macro-averaged true-positive-based metrics, like precision, recall and utility fail to capture essential information when applied in a batch setting. In particular, false positives returned in a batch for topics that are absent from the ground truth in that batch go unnoticed. This is a serious flaw as over-generation of a system might be overlooked this way. We propose a new metric, aptness, that does capture false positives. We incorporate this metric in an overall score and show that this new score does meet all requirements. To demonstrate the results of our proposed evaluation methodology, we analyze the runs submitted to the two most recent editions of a document filtering evaluation campaign.
